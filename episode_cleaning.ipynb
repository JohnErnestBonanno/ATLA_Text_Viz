      "[Introduction sequence - The introduction to this first episode is longer than the standard sequence that introduces the rest of the Avatar episodes. It contains more background than the standard sequence. The animation contains some additions to accommodate the longer narrative. The trip through the map to the Fire Nation amphibious assault is longer, the shot of the Avatar silhouetted by the sun is longer, and the third paragraph below is accompanied by a pan right shot over a still frame that shows a burning landscape ravaged by war. Also, the narration around the departure of her father is voiced over shots of the Water Tribe ships departing, and of a younger Katara and Sokka watching them leave. Lastly, the stone pinnacle on which Aang stands in future episodes is empty.]\n",

      "My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.\n",
      "Only the Avatar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.\n",
      "A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.\n",
      "Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.\n",

      "(The show opens with an overhead shot of iceberg laden waters. The screen pans left and rotates showing footprints in the snow, then fades to soaring pan shot from the air of the icy waters. As if the shot were taken from the outside of an airplane, the camera banks left as it moves forward. It comes to rest and slowly zooms in on a two person canoe out among the icebergs. Cut to a closer shot of the canoe. A teenage boy, Sokka, shaven headed except for a pony tail, stands in the canoe. He looks down at the water, spear at the ready. The other occupant is a young girl. Both wear blue overcoats. The canoe drifts slowly as the boy concentrates on fishing. Cut to a close, overhead shot of the canoe. Beside the boat a fish swims close to the surface in front of the boy.)\n",

      ": It's not getting away from me this time. Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.\n",
      "(Katara leans over the edge of the canoe to see a fish. Hesitantly, she removes her left glove. She takes a deep breather and with a look of trepidation begins to motion with her exposed hand. Suddenly, a globe of water containing the fish bursts out of the water.)\n",

      ": It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's-\n",
      "Sokka\n",

      "Katara\n",
      ": You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water.\n",
      "(Cut to Sokka, who is making a muscle and looking at his reflection in the water. He turns to Katara and gives her a look. Suddenly the boat is bumped, they look up to see they have entered an ice packed area. The begin to work frantically to maneuver the canoe between the icebergs.)\n",

      "Katara\n",
      ": Watch out! Go left! Go left!\n",
      "(Cut to an overhead shot of the canoe as it threads its way through the ice pack. Icebergs are colliding all around them. Each time they manage to avoid getting crushed between the colliding icebergs, but their safety margins decreases rapidly each time. Finally the canoe is crushed when three icebergs collide at once. Sokka and Katara jump out in time onto one of the icebergs. Cut to a wide shot of the ice field. They are now at the mercy of the currents. Then cut back to the kids.)\n",
      "Katara\n",

      "Sokka\n",
      ": You don't like my steering. Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.\n",

      "Katara\n",
      ": So it's my fault?\n",
      "Sokka\n",
      ": I knew I should have left you home. Leave it to a girl to screw things up.\n",

      "Katara\n",
      ": You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...\n",
      "(As she gets more excited, the iceberg on which they are sitting begins to heave. Switch to a wider shot, where the huge iceberg behind her cracks.)\n",
      "Katara\n",
      ": Ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you! Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!\n",

      "Katara\n",
      ": No, that's it. I'm done helping you. From now on, you're on your own!\n",
      "(By the end she is screaming. As she finishes, the iceberg behind her splits open entirely. It disintegrates and the major pieces fall into the water, pushing their iceberg away. They hold on desperately until the iceberg settles.)\n",
      "Sokka\n",
      ": Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.\n",
      "Katara\n",
      ": You mean I did that?\n",
      "Sokka\n",
      ": Yup. Congratulations.\n",
      "(They both are leaning over the edge of the iceberg raft. Suddenly, the water just in front of them begins to glow an incandescent blue. They move backwards on their raft as another, lighter colored iceberg breaks the surface. It is unclear whether this is part of the one Katara broke up or not. As the new iceberg settles, Katara walks to edge of their iceberg raft to get a better look. Deep in the ice, the figure of a boy in a meditation pose is seen. He has white arrows on his fists and on his bald head. Suddenly, his eyes glow and his arrow markings glow white.)\n",
      "Katara\n",
      ": He's alive! We have to help.\n",
      "(She grabs Sokka's hockey stick type spear, pulls down her hood and turns to go to the boy.) \n",
      "Sokka\n",
      ": Katara! Get back here! We don't know what that thing is!\n",
      "(Katara ignores him and skips across a few little icebergs to arrive at the one in which the boy is trapped. Sokka follows. She begins to use the hockey stick to whack the ice. After a few big whacks, she cracks open the ice. It looks like air is released, as if the iceberg had a hollow chamber within it, but it is not entirely clear. The iceberg then cracks from top to bottom and explodes open. A huge shaft of white blue light shoots straight into the heavens. Cut to a quick shot of the iceberg from underwater where it glows brightly, then to shot an above ground shot from somewhere nearby where the shaft of light and the aurora australis is clearly seen in the background. The foreground is occupied by a herd of tiger seals, who rear themselves up and roar at the phenomenon.\n",
      "Cut to a view of an iron hulled battleship with a spiked prow cutting through the sea also nearby. It is apparently steam powered as it has a single smokestack. The foredeck is much longer than the afterdeck. The bridge appears to be several decks above the main deck. Cut to a shot of the back of a young man on the foredeck dressed in red, also shaven-headed except for a pony-tail, staring intently at the shaft of light in front of the ship. Then cut to a shot of his face, still illuminated by the shaft of light. The left side of his face is badly scarred around his left eye. This is Prince Zuko. The light from the light shaft dissipates.)\n",
      "Zuko\n",
      ": Finally. \n",
      "(He turns to address someone o.c.)\n",
      " Uncle, do you realize what this means?\n",
      "(Cut to an old man seated cross legged at a low table, drinking tea and playing a game involving domino like objects.)\n",
      "Iroh\n",
      ": I won't get to finish my game?\n",
      "Zuko\n",
      ": It means my search - it's about to come to an end.\n",
      "(Iroh groans.)\n",
      "Zuko\n",
      ": That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!\n",
      "Iroh\n",
      ": Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?\n",
      "Zuko\n",
      " (\n",
      "exploding in anger\n",
      "): I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar. Helmsman, head a course for the light!\n",
      "(Cut back to a wide shot of the exploded iceberg, which quickly shifts to Sokka still shielding his sister from the blast that just dissipated. They look up to see residual blue light still swirling around the top of what is left of the iceberg. Suddenly, the boy appears, his eyes and arrow markings still aglow.)\n",
      "Sokka\n",
      " (\n",
      "raising his spear at the boy\n",
      "): Stop!\n",
      "(The boy stands up as the glow and residual energy fades. He seems to pass out and slides down the side of the ruined iceberg to Sokka and Katara, who lunges forward and catches him as he falls. Sokka pokes Aang in the head with the blunt end of his weapon.)\n",
      "Katara\n",
      ": Stop it!\n",
      "(She gives Sokka the Heisman and turns to the boy. She gently turns him over so that he is lying on his back. He begins to wake up. He slowly opens his eyes and the camera switches to the boy's p.o.v. to show his view of Katara. A breeze gently blows her braids and we hear him intake a breath.)\n",
      "Aang\n",
      " (\n",
      "whispering in a weak voice\n",
      "): I need to ask you something.\n",

      " (\n",
      "batting the spear anway, absently\n",
      "): I'm not sure.\n",
      "(Aang gasps as a low, animal like noise is heard from o.c. and begins to frantically climb back up the ruined iceberg. He jumps over the lip of what is in fact now a crater and lands on a huge furry animal.) \n",
      "Aang\n",
      ": Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.\n",
      "(He leans down and opens one of the beasts eyes. He closes it again. Aang hops down and tries to lift the animal's huge head, but without effect. Katara and Sokka come around the corner and their mouths drop in shock as the see the monster, whose mouth opens and licks the boy trying to wake him up.)\n",
      "Aang\n",
      ": Haha! You're okay!\n",
      "(He hugs Appa, then cut to a wide shot of the destroyed iceberg. Appa occupies most of the crater left by the explosion. He is a huge flying bison with six legs and horns like a steer. He gets up and shakes himself off a bit.)\n",
      "Sokka\n",
      ": What is that thing?\n",
      "Aang\n",
      ": This is Appa, my flying bison.\n",
      "Sokka\n",
      ": Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.\n",

      ": Ugh!\n",
      "Aang\n",
      ": So, do you guys live around here?\n",
      "Sokka\n",
      ": Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.\n",
      "Katara\n",
      ": Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye.\n",
      "(Cut to a shot of Aang's innocent face, his smile accompanied by a funny sound effect.)\n",
      "Katara\n",
      ": The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.\n",
      "Aang\n",
      ": I'm A... aaaahhhh... ahhhhhh.... aaah aaah aaah AAAAAAACHOOOO!\n",
      "(As Aang sneezes he zooms of the ground far into the air. He responds to her question after he lands to the whistling sound of a bomb dropping.) \n",

      ": I'm Aang. \n",
      "(He sniffles and rubs his nose.)\n",

      ": Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders... I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.\n",
      "(Sokka turns to walk off, but is stopped at the iceberg's edge. The camera zooms way out to show how desolate the area is. Just sea and ice.)\n",
      "Aang\n",
      ": Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.\n",
      "(Aang airbends himself onto Appa's head, then to the top of his back where rests an enormous saddle. Reigns are attached to both of Appa's great horns.)\n",

      "Katara\n",
      ": Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know... before you freeze to death?\n",
      "(Sokka starts to say something and gives up before he does. He sighs. Cut to Katara and Sokka in the back part of the saddle. Katara looks excited. Sokka looks grumpy, arms folded across his chest.)\n",
      "Aang\n",
      ": Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip yip!\n",
      "(Aang shakes the reigns and Appa makes a low rumble. Cut to a rear shot of Appa. He flaps his huge beaver tail and then launches into the air. He spreads his legs wide, but then comes right back down into the water with a huge splash. He begins to swim them forward.)\n",
      "Aang\n",

      "Aang\n",
      ": Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.\n",
      "(He makes a “soaring through the sky” motion with his hand, his eyes finally resting on Katara. He leaves them there, a smile on his face as he looks at her.)\n",

      ": I'm going to bed now.\n",
      " (He makes an exaggerated yawn)\n",
      " Yep. A man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.\n",
      "Zuko\n",
      ": Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.\n",
      "(Fade back to a long shot of Appa swimming, his friends on his back. Cut to a closer, overhead shot. Aang lies back on top of Appa's head. Katara, in the saddle on Appa's back with her brother, crawls forward and looks down from the saddle at Aang.)\n",

      "Aang\n",
      ": Aaahhh!\n",
      "(Cut to an underwater shot, where Aang and Appa suddenly penetrate the surface and enter the watery depths. They come up briefly for air, Appa groans, but they are once again driven under the storm tossed waves. As they drift downward, Aang drops Appa's reigns and begins to lose consciousness. Suddenly, Aang's eyes and markings glow white. He puts his hands together and he freezes himself and Appa in a huge ball of ice.)\n",
