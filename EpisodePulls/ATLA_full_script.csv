1,Katara," Sokka, look!",101,2.0
2,Sokka,"  Shhh. Katara, you're gonna scare it away. Mmmm... I can already smell it cookin'!",101,14.0
3,Katara, Hey!  But Sokka! I caught one!,101,6.0
4,Sokka, Ugh! Why is it that every time you play with magic water I get soaked?,101,15.0
5,Katara," It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's-",101,7.0
6,Sokka," Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah. Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.",101,28.0
7,Katara, You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water.,101,22.0
8,Sokka, Ahhh!,101,1.0
9,Katara, You call that left?  Watch out! Go left! Go left!,101,10.0
10,Sokka," You don't like my steering. Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.",101,16.0
11,Katara, So it's my fault?,101,4.0
12,Sokka, I knew I should have left you home. Leave it to a girl to screw things up.,101,17.0
13,Katara," Ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you! Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!  You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...",101,34.0
14,Sokka, Uh... Katara?,101,2.0
15,Katara," I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, NOT PLEASANT!",101,19.0
16,Sokka, Katara! Settle down!,101,3.0
17,Katara," No, that's it. I'm done helping you. From now on, you're on your own!",101,14.0
18,Sokka," Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.",101,8.0

23,Zuko," Finally.  Uncle, do you realize what this means?",101,8.0
24,Iroh, I won't get to finish my game?,101,7.0
25,Zuko, That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!  It means my search - it's about to come to an end.,101,25.0
26,Iroh," Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?",101,36.0
27,Zuko," I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar. Helmsman, head a course for the light!",101,19.0
28,Sokka, Stop!,101,1.0
29,Katara, Stop it!,101,2.0
30,Aang, I need to ask you something.,101,6.0
31,Katara, What?,101,1.0
32,Aang, Please... come closer.,101,3.0
33,Katara, What is it?,101,3.0
34,Aang, Will you go penguin sledding with me?,101,7.0
35,Katara, Uh... sure. I guess.,101,4.0
36,Sokka, Ahh!,101,1.0
37,Aang, What's going on here?,101,4.0
38,Sokka, You tell us! How'd you get in the ice?  And why aren't you frozen?,101,14.0
39,Aang," Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.  I'm not sure.",101,11.0
40,Sokka, What is that thing?,101,4.0
41,Aang," This is Appa, my flying bison.",101,6.0
42,Sokka," Ewww! Aahh!!!  Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.",101,10.0
43,Aang, Don't worry. It'll wash out.,101,5.0
44,Sokka, Ugh!,101,1.0
45,Aang," So, do you guys live around here?",101,7.0
46,Sokka, Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.,101,20.0
47,Katara," The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye.",101,34.0
48,Aang, I'm Aang.   I'm A... aaaahhhh... ahhhhhh.... aaah aaah aaah AAAAAAACHOOOO!,101,10.0
49,Sokka,  You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.,101,10.0
50,Aang, Really? It felt higher that that.,101,6.0
51,Katara, You're an airbender!,101,3.0
52,Aang, Sure am.,101,2.0
53,Sokka, Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders... I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.,101,21.0

56,Sokka," Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.",101,11.0
57,Katara, Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know... before you freeze to death?,101,24.0
58,Aang," Come on, Appa. Yip yip.  Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip yip!",101,15.0
59,Sokka, Wow. That was truly amazing.,101,5.0
60,Aang, Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.,101,15.0
61,Katara, Why are you smiling at me like that?,101,8.0
62,Aang, Oh... I was smiling?,101,4.0
63,Sokka, Uuuuugh.,101,1.0
64,Iroh," I'm going to bed now. Yep. A man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.",101,39.0
65,Zuko, Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.,101,19.0
66,Katara, Hey.,101,1.0
67,Aang, Hey. Whatcha thinkin' about?,101,4.0
68,Katara, I guess I was wondering – your being an airbender and all – if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.,101,23.0
69,Aang," Uhh... no. I didn't know him... I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry.",101,18.0
70,Katara, Okay. Just curious. Goodnight.,101,4.0
71,Aang, Aaahhh!  Sleep tight.<u,101,3.0

73,Aang, Whaaaa!,101,1.0
74,Katara," Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.",101,9.0
75,Aang, Uh... why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?,101,15.0
76,Gran Gran," Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.",101,23.0
77,Aang, 'Extinct'?,101,1.0
78,Katara," Aang, this is my grandmother.",101,5.0
79,Gran Gran, Call me Gran Gran.,101,4.0
80,Sokka," What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this.",101,11.0
81,Aang, It's not for stabbing.  It's for airbending.,101,7.0
82,Little Girl, Magic trick! Do it again!,101,5.0
83,Aang," Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.",101,15.0
84,Sokka," You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.",101,9.0
85,Aang, Check again!,101,2.0
86,Villagers, Whoa... it's flying... it's amazing!,101,5.0
87,Aang, Oof!,101,1.0
88,Sokka, My watchtower!,101,2.0
89,Katara, That was amazing.,101,3.0
90,Sokka," Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.",101,16.0
91,Aang, You're a waterbender!,101,3.0
92,Katara, Well... sort of. Not yet.,101,5.0
93,Gran Gran," All right. No more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.",101,11.0
94,Katara," I told you! He's the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me.",101,17.0
95,Gran Gran," Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.",101,11.0
96,Katara, But he's special. I can tell. I sense he's filled with much wisdom.,101,13.0
97,Aang,  Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.,101,9.0
98,Children, Tee hee!,101,2.0
99,Iroh, Again.,101,1.0
100,Zuko, Ha! Heeya!,101,2.0
101,Iroh, No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles. The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.  Get it right this time.,101,32.0
102,Zuko, Enough. I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready.,101,17.0
103,Iroh," No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics.  Drill it again!",101,14.0
104,Zuko, Grrrr... huh!  The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements. I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. You WILL teach me the advanced set!,101,48.0
105,Iroh, Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck.  Num num... num...,101,13.0
106,Sokka," Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing. For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?",101,34.0
107,Little Boy, I gotta pee!,101,3.0
108,Sokka," Listen! Until your fathers return from the war, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe. And that means no potty breaks.",101,25.0
109,Little Boy, But I really gotta go.,101,5.0
110,Sokka, Okay... who else has to go?,101,6.0
111,Katara, Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.,101,13.0
112,Aang, Wow! Everything freezes in there!,101,5.0
113,Children, Hahaha!,101,1.0
114,Sokka," Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.",101,13.0
115,Kid, Wheeee!,101,1.0
116,Sokka, Stop! Stop it right now! What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.,101,22.0
117,Aang, What war? What are you talking about?,101,7.0
118,Sokka," You're kidding, right?",101,3.0
119,Aang, PENGUIN!,101,1.0
120,Sokka," He's kidding, right?<u",101,3.0
121,Katara, Aang?,101,1.0
122,Aang," Oof! Heh heh, I have a way with animals.  Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp!  Haha! Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding?",101,25.0
123,Katara,"  Hahaha... Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.",101,13.0
124,Aang," You got a deal! Just one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?",101,24.0
125,Katara, No. You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.,101,12.0
126,Aang," This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.",101,29.0
127,Katara, Maybe. But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly 'turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.,101,31.0
128,Aang, But you forget,101,3.0
129,Katara," That's... ( I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before.",101,12.0
130,Aang," Well, you think about it. But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?",101,19.0
131,Katara," I haven't done this since I was a kid!  Okay, listen closely my young pupil. Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe.",101,24.0
132,Aang, Whoa... what is that?  You still are a kid!,101,9.0
133,Katara," Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.  A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.",101,27.0
134,Aang," If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.",101,13.0
135,Katara, This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.,101,22.0
136,Aang," Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.",101,20.0
137,Katara," Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?",101,8.0
138,Aang," I don't know... a few days, maybe?",101,7.0
139,Katara, I think it was more like a hundred years!,101,9.0
140,Aang, What? That's impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?,101,14.0
141,Katara," Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there that whole time. It's the only explanation.",101,27.0
142,Aang, A hundred years! I can't believe it.,101,7.0
143,Katara," I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.",101,12.0
144,Aang, I did get to meet you.,101,6.0
145,Katara, Aang? Let's head back. This place is creepy.  Come on. Let's get out of here.,101,15.0
146,Aang, What's that you said about booby traps?  Huh?,101,8.0
147,Zuko, ...as well as his hiding place.  The last airbender.  Quite agile for his old age. Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar...,101,24.0
148,Children, Yay! Aang's back!,102,3.0
149,Sokka," I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?",102,19.0
150,Katara, Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident.,102,8.0
151,Aang," Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well...  ...we “boobied” right into it.",102,19.0
152,Gran Gran," Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship. Now we could all be in danger!",102,15.0
153,Aang, Don't blame Katara! I brought her there.  It's my fault.,102,10.0
154,Sokka," Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy!  The foreigner is banned from our village!",102,16.0
155,Katara," Sokka, you're making a mistake.",102,5.0
156,Sokka, No! I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you from threats like him!,102,14.0
157,Katara, Aang is not our enemy! Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time. Fun.,102,20.0
158,Sokka, Fun? We can't fight firebenders with fun!,102,7.0
159,Aang, You should try it sometime.,102,5.0
160,Sokka, Get out of our village. Now!,102,6.0
161,Katara," Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.",102,7.0
162,Gran Gran," Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.",102,20.0
163,Katara," C'mon, Aang, let's go!  Then I'm banished too!",102,8.0
164,Sokka, Where do you think you're going?,102,6.0
165,Katara, To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole!,102,12.0
166,Aang, I am? Great!,102,3.0
167,Sokka, Katara!  Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?,102,12.0
168,Aang," Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.",102,11.0
169,Katara," So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?",102,9.0
170,Aang, Thanks for penguin sledding with me.,102,6.0
171,Katara, Where will you go?,102,4.0
172,Aang," It was nice meeting everyone.  Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders.  Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that. ",102,30.0
173,Sokka," Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.",102,8.0
174,Aang," Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!",102,9.0
175,Sokka," Yeh, I thought so.",102,4.0
176,Little Girl, Aang! Don't go! We'll miss you!,102,6.0
177,Aang , I'll miss you too.,102,4.0
178,Aang," Come on, boy..)",102,3.0
179,Gran Gran," Katara, you'll feel better after you –",102,7.0
180,Katara, You happy now? There goes my one chance of becoming a waterbender!,102,12.0
181,Sokka, All right! Ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!,102,16.0
182,Little Boy," But, I gotta –",102,4.0
183,Sokka, And no potty breaks!,102,4.0
184,Aang," The village!  Appa, wait here!  Yeh, I liked her too.",102,10.0
185,Sokka," Ohhh, man!  Oh man!",102,4.0
186,Katara," Sokka, get out of the way!",102,6.0
187,Zuko, He'd be about this age? Master of all elements?  Where are you hiding him?,102,14.0
188,Little Boy, Show no fear!,102,3.0

193,Katara, Aang?,102,1.0
194,Sokka, No way.,102,2.0
195,Zuko, I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. Meditating. You're just a child!,102,13.0

201,Sokka," Katara, I—",102,2.0

208,Gran Gran," You'll need these. You have a long journey ahead of you. It's been so long since I've had hope. But you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.  And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister.  What do you two think you're doing? ",102,46.0
209,Sokka," Yeah... okay, Gran.",102,3.0

212,Sokka," You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?",102,12.0
213,Zuko," This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And  take this to my quarters.",102,34.0
214,Iroh," Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?",102,10.0
215,Aang, So... I guess you never fought an airbender before. I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.,102,23.0

246,Aang, And how am I going to do that?,102,8.0
247,Katara," According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?",102,14.0
248,Aang, That's what the monks told me.,102,6.0
249,Katara," Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.",102,12.0
250,Aang, We can learn it together!,102,5.0
251,Katara," And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.",102,14.0
252,Sokka, I'd like that. I'd really like that.,102,7.0
253,Katara, Then we're in this together.,102,5.0
254,Aang," All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to  here, here, and here.",102,19.0
255,Katara, What's there?,102,2.0
256,Aang," Here  we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaaay over here  we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!",102,39.0
257,Aang,"  Wait 'til you see it, Katara. The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world.",103,19.0
258,Katara,"  Aang, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.",103,15.0
259,Aang, That's why I'm so excited!,103,5.0
260,Katara, It's just that a lot can change in all that time.,103,11.0
261,Aang," Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple here we come!  I know, but I need to see it for myself.",103,18.0
262,Sokka, Sleep now... temple later...,103,4.0
263,Aang, Sokka! Wake up!  There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!,103,11.0
264,Sokka,  Aaahhh! Get it off! Get it off! Aaahhh! ,103,8.0
265,Aang,  Great! You're awake. Let's go.,103,5.0
266,Zuko," Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.",103,22.0
267,Iroh, You mean the Avatar?,103,4.0
268,Zuko,  Don't mention his name on these docks! Once word gets out that he's alive every firebender will be out looking for him and I don't want anyone getting in the way.,103,31.0
269,Zhao,"  Getting in the way of what, Prince Zuko?",103,8.0
270,Zuko,  Captain Zhao.,103,2.0
271,Zhao, It's Commander now. And General Iroh--  --great hero of our nation.,103,11.0
272,Iroh,  general.,103,1.0
273,Zhao, The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests any time. What brings you to my harbor?,103,17.0
274,Iroh, Our ship is being repaired. ,103,5.0
275,Zhao, That's quite a bit of damage.,103,6.0
276,Zuko, Yes... you wouldn't believe what happened.  Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.,103,12.0
277,Iroh," Yes, I will do that. It was incredible.  What... did we crash or something?",103,14.0
278,Zuko,"  Uh, yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.",103,8.0
279,Zhao, Really? You must regale me with all the thrilling details.  Join me for a drink?,103,15.0
280,Zuko," Sorry, but we have to go.",103,6.0
281,Iroh," Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.  We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.",103,23.0
282,Sokka," Hey! Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky?   Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food. ",103,21.0
283,Aang," Oh, that was ? I used it to start the campfire last night. Sorry.",103,14.0
284,Sokka,"  You WHAT? Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good.",103,10.0
285,Aang, The Batola mountain range! We're almost there!,103,7.0
286,Katara,"  Aang? Before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.",103,16.0
287,Aang, What about 'em?,103,3.0
288,Katara,"  Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. They killed my mother and they could have done the same to your people.",103,32.0
289,Aang,  Just because no one has  an airbender doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.  They probably escaped.,103,18.0
290,Katara, I know it's hard to accept.,103,6.0
291,Aang,"  Yip yip!   You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison. Right, Appa?",103,32.0
292,Katara," Aang, it's amazing!",103,3.0
293,Aang,"  We're home, buddy. We're home.",103,5.0
294,Zhao," The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.   And by year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule.  ",103,23.0
295,Zuko,"  If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool. ",103,18.0
296,Zhao," Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue.  So, how is your search for the Avatar going?",103,20.0
297,Iroh,  My fault entirely. ,103,3.0
298,Zuko,  We haven't found him yet.,103,5.0
299,Zhao, Unless you found some evidence that the Avatar is alive.   Did you really expect to? The Avatar died a hundred years ago--  --along with the rest of the airbenders. ,103,29.0
300,Zuko,  No. Nothing.,103,2.0
301,Zhao,"  Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war.  If you have an --  --of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you've found.",103,32.0
302,Zuko,"  I haven't  anything. It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago. Come on, Uncle, we're going.",103,20.0
303,Guard," Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody, but let him escape.",103,22.0
304,Zhao," ... how exactly was your ship damaged?   Now, remind me... ",103,10.0
305,Sokka, So where do I get something to eat? ,103,8.0
306,Katara, You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to  visit an airbender temple and all you can think about is food? ,103,23.0
307,Sokka, I'm just a simple guy with simple needs.,103,8.0
308,Aang, And... over there would be where the bison would sleep... and...   So that's where my friends and I would play airball!,103,21.0
309,Katara, What's wrong?,103,2.0
310,Aang, I can't believe how much things have changed.   This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds.  ,103,27.0
311,Sokka," So, uh, this airball game? How do you play? ",103,9.0
312,Aang," Hahaha! Aang seven, Sokka zero! ",103,5.0
313,Sokka," Katara, check this out.   Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt.",103,16.0
314,Katara,  Fire Nation.,103,2.0
315,Sokka, We should tell him.,103,4.0
316,Katara,"  Aang, there's something you need to see.",103,7.0
317,Aang, What is it?   Okay!,103,4.0
318,Katara,  Uh... just a new waterbending move I learned.,103,8.0
319,Aang, Nice one. But enough practicing. We have a whole temple to see! ,103,12.0
320,Sokka," Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't.  You know, you can't protect him forever.<u",103,16.0
321,Katara," If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.   I can for Aang's sake. ",103,19.0
322,Aang, I want you to meet somebody.   Hey guys! ,103,8.0
323,Sokka, Who's that?,103,2.0
324,Aang," Monk Gyatso, the greatest airbender in the world. He taught me everything I know. ",103,14.0
325,Gyatso, ... is in the gooey center!  But the true secret...,103,10.0
326,Aang, Hmm...,103,1.0
327,Gyatso," My ancient cake making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang?",103,15.0
328,Aang, This whole Avatar thing... maybe the monks made a mistake.,103,10.0
329,Gyatso, The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned sixteen. But we can't concern ourselves with what . We must act on what .,103,26.0
330,Aang,"  But Gyatso, how do I know if I'm ready for this?",103,11.0
331,Gyatso,  Your questions will be answered when you are old enough to enter the Air Temple sanctuary.  Inside you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey.,103,28.0
332,Aang,  Who is it?,103,3.0
333,Gyatso," Now, are you going to help me with these cakes, or not?  When you are ready he will reveal himself to you. ",103,22.0
334,Aang,  All right.,103,2.0
335,Gyatso, Hahaha!  One... two... three!,103,4.0
336,Katara,  You must miss him.,103,4.0
337,Aang, Yeah. ,103,1.0
338,Katara, Where are you going?,103,4.0
339,Aang,  The Air Temple Sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet. ,103,10.0
340,Katara, But Aang... no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.,103,13.0
341,Aang, It's not impossible. I survived in the iceberg for that long.,103,11.0
342,Katara, Good point.,103,2.0
343,Aang," Katara, whoever's in there might help me figure out this Avatar thing!",103,12.0
344,Sokka," I don't suppose you have a key?   And whoever's in there might have a medley of delicious, cured meats!",103,19.0
345,Aang,"  Hello? Anyone home?   The key, Sokka, is airbending.",103,8.0
346,Zhao," So, a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders?  You're more pathetic than I thought.",103,15.0
347,Zuko," I underestimated him once, but it will not happen again.",103,10.0
348,Zhao," No, it will not, because you won't have a second chance.",103,11.0
349,Zuko,"  Commander Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I...",103,12.0
350,Zhao, Capturing the Avatar is too important to leave in a teenager's hands. He's mine now.   And you failed! ,103,18.0
351,Iroh, More tea please?,103,3.0
352,Sokka, Statues?! That's it? Where's the meat? ,103,6.0
353,Katara, Who are all these people?,103,5.0
354,Aang,"  I'm not sure, but it feels like I know them somehow. Look!  That one's an airbender!",103,16.0
355,Katara,"  And this one's a waterbender. They're lined up in a pattern. Air, water, earth and fire.",103,16.0
356,Aang, That's the Avatar cycle.,103,4.0
357,Katara," Of course! They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang.",103,12.0
358,Aang, Wow! There's so many!,103,4.0
359,Sokka,"  Past lives? Katara, you really believe in that stuff?",103,9.0
360,Katara," Aang, snap out of it!  It's true. When the Avatar dies he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.",103,20.0
361,Aang,  Huh?,103,1.0
362,Katara, Who is that?,103,3.0
363,Aang," That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.",103,7.0
364,Sokka, You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.,103,14.0
365,Katara, There's no writing. How do you know his name?,103,9.0
366,Aang, I'm not sure... I just know it somehow.,103,8.0
367,Sokka,  Firebender. Nobody make a sound.   You just couldn't get any weirder!,103,11.0
368,Katara,  You're making a sound!,103,4.0
369,Sokka,  That firebender won't know what hit 'em.  Shhhh!<u,103,8.0
370,Aang, Lemur!,103,1.0
371,Sokka,  Dinner...,103,1.0
372,Aang, Don't listen to him! You're going to be my new pet.,103,11.0
373,Sokka, Not if I get him first!,103,6.0
374,Aang,  Wait! Come back!,103,3.0
375,Sokka, Oof!   I wanna eat you!,103,5.0
376,Zhao," Once I'm out to sea, my guards will escort you back to your ship and you'll be free to go.  My search party is ready. ",103,25.0
377,Zuko, Why? Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?,103,11.0
378,Zhao,  You? Stop me? Impossible.,103,4.0
379,Zuko,"  Don't underestimate me, Zhao. I  capture the Avatar  you. ",103,9.0
380,Iroh,"  Prince Zuko, that's enough!",103,4.0
381,Zhao," You can't compete with me. I have hundreds of warships under my command, and you... you're just a banished prince. No home. No allies. Your own father doesn't even want you.",103,31.0
382,Zuko, You're wrong. Once I deliver the Avatar to my father he will welcome me home with honor and restore my rightful place on the throne.,103,25.0
383,Zhao,"  If your father really wanted you home, he'd have let you return by now, Avatar or no Avatar, but in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.",103,33.0
384,Zuko, That's not true.,103,3.0
385,Zhao, You have the scar to prove it.,103,7.0
386,Zuko,  Maybe you'd like one to match!,103,6.0
387,Zhao, Is that a challenge?,103,4.0
388,Zuko, An . At sunset.,103,4.0
389,Zhao, Very well. It's a shame your father won't be here to watch me humiliate you. I guess your uncle will do.,103,21.0
390,Iroh," Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?",103,13.0
391,Zuko, I will never forget. ,103,4.0
392,Aang," Come on out, little lemur. That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.  Hey! Come back!  ",103,15.0
393,Sokka," Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay?  Oh, man... come on, Aang, everything will be all right. Let's get out of here.   Hey Aang, you find my dinner yet?  ",103,32.0
394,Katara,  Aang!,103,1.0
395,Old Sage, Send word to the Fire Lord immediately. The Avatar has returned! ,103,11.0
396,Sokka," Aaahhh!  Aang! Come on, snap out of it!",103,8.0
397,Katara, What happened?,103,2.0
398,Sokka, He found out firebenders killed Gyatso.,103,6.0
399,Katara," Oh no, it's his avatar spirit! He must have triggered it! I'm gonna try and calm him down.",103,18.0
400,Sokka,"  Well, do it before he blows us off the mountain! ",103,10.0
401,Iroh," Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.",103,11.0
402,Zuko,  I refuse to let him win. ,103,6.0
403,Zhao, This will be over quickly. ,103,5.0
404,Iroh," Basics, Zuko! Break his root!",103,5.0
405,Zhao, That's it? Your father raised a coward.  Do it! ,103,9.0
406,Zuko," Next time you get in my way, I promise I won't hold back.",103,13.0
407,Iroh," So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat.  Disgraceful.   No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory. ",103,20.0
408,Zuko,"  Did you really mean that, Uncle?",103,6.0
409,Iroh,  Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.,103,10.0
410,Katara," ... and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family. Sokka and I, we're your family now.   Aang, I know you're upset... ",103,52.0
411,Sokka,  Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.,103,12.0
412,Aang,  I'm sorry.,103,2.0
413,Katara, It's okay. It wasn't your fault.,103,6.0
414,Aang,"  But you were right. And if firebenders found this temple that means they found the other ones, too. I really am the last airbender. ",103,24.0
415,Katara, Everything's packed. You ready to go?,103,6.0
416,Aang,  How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?,103,13.0
417,Katara, Maybe you'll find a way.,103,5.0
418,Aang," Looks like you made a new friend, Sokka.",103,8.0
419,Sokka,  Can't talk. Must eat.,103,4.0
420,Aang," You, me, and Appa.  We're all that's left of this place. We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka...    Hey little guy.",103,21.0
421,Katara, What are you going to name him?,103,7.0
422,Aang,  Momo.,103,1.0
423,Zuko,  The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the Avatar. ,104,16.0
424,Iroh,"  Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset. ",104,16.0
425,Zuko,"  Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it. ",104,29.0
426,Iroh," Okay, then... we have no idea where he is. ",104,9.0
427,Zuko,  WHAT?!,104,1.0
428,Iroh,  You really should open a window in here.,104,8.0
429,Zuko,  Give me the map!,104,4.0
430,Iroh," There have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.",104,15.0
431,Zuko," He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.   How am I gonna find him, Uncle?  ",104,15.0
432,Sokka," You have no idea where you're going, do you?",104,9.0
433,Aang,"  Weeelll, I know it's near water...",104,6.0
434,Sokka,  I guess we're getting close then.,104,6.0
435,Aang,"  Hey Katara! Check out this airbending trick!  Momo, marbles please.",104,10.0
436,Katara,"  That's great, Aang.",104,3.0
437,Aang,  You didn't even look.,104,4.0
438,Katara,  That's great!,104,2.0
439,Aang, But I'm not doing it now.,104,6.0
440,Sokka,"  Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.",104,15.0
441,Katara, What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?,104,11.0
442,Sokka, Simple,104,1.0
443,Katara,  All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!,104,13.0
444,Sokka," Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these!  Katara, PLEASE!",104,11.0
445,Aang," Don't worry, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!",104,11.0
446,Sokka, We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?,104,19.0
447,Katara, He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring.,104,14.0
448,Aang,"  But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy? I , aren't you boy? ",104,12.0
449,Sokka," Yeah, that was  convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster.",104,14.0
450,Aang,"  LOOK!  That's why we're here... ... elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it. Katara, you've gotta watch me!  COLD!",104,20.0
451,Katara,  Woo!,104,1.0
452,Aang, Yeeaaaah! Woohoo! ,104,2.0
453,Katara, He looks pretty good out there.,104,6.0
454,Sokka, Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.,104,10.0
455,Katara,"  No, Appa! Don't eat that! ",104,5.0
456,Aang," Aww, man...",104,2.0
457,Sokka,  There's something in the water!,104,5.0
458,Katara, What's wrong?,104,2.0
459,Sokka, Aang's in trouble.  Aang!,104,4.0
460,Katara,  Get out of there!,104,4.0
461,Sokka, Come back here! AANG!,104,4.0
462,Katara, AANG!,104,1.0
463,Aang, Aaahhh!,104,1.0
464,Katara, What was that thing?,104,4.0
465,Aang, I don't know.,104,3.0
466,Sokka,"  Well, let's not stick around and find out. Time to hit the road.",104,13.0
467,Momo,  Oof!,104,1.0
468,Aang,  Ugh!,104,1.0
469,Katara,  Uhh...,104,1.0
470,Sokka,  Oof... Or we could stay a while...,104,7.0
471,Oyagi, You three have some explaining to do.,104,7.0
472,Suki," And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with the unagi.",104,18.0
473,Sokka,"  Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?   Show yourselves, cowards!",104,13.0
474,Suki,"  There were no men.  ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?",104,18.0
475,Sokka,"  Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.",104,14.0
476,Suki,"  A bunch of girls, huh? The unagi's gonna eat well tonight.",104,11.0
477,Katara,"  No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.",104,15.0
478,Aang,  It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.,104,15.0
479,Oyagi,  How do we know you're not Fire Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!,104,25.0
480,Aang, This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!,104,9.0
481,Oyagi, Ha! How could you possibly know her? Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. She's been dead for centuries.,104,21.0
482,Aang, I know her because I'm the Avatar.,104,7.0
483,Suki,  That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.,104,14.0
484,Aang, That's me!,104,2.0
485,Oyagi, Throw the imposter to the unagi!,104,6.0

738,King Bumi," Oh, Aang. It's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally.",105,13.0
739,Katara," Uh, over here!",105,3.0
740,Sokka, Little help?,105,2.0
741,King Bumi, Genemite is made of rock candy. . Delicious!,105,8.0
742,Katara," So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?",105,9.0
743,King Bumi, Who you calling old?  Okay. I'm old.,105,7.0
744,Sokka, Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?,105,14.0
745,King Bumi," First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people, hehe , but I do have a reason. . Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord, and when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius!  And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation.  And you'll need Momo too.",105,105.0
746,Aang," Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!",105,15.0
747,Cabbage Merchant, My cabbages!,105,2.0
748,Aang," Great, you're back! What's for dinner?",106,6.0
749,Sokka," We've got a few options. First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts, and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks. Dig in!",106,27.0
750,Katara," Seriously, what else ya got?",106,5.0
751,Sokka, What was that!?,106,3.0
752,Aang, It's coming from over there!,106,5.0
753,Sokka, Shouldn't we run away from huge booms – not toward them?,106,11.0
754,Katara, An earthbender!,106,2.0
755,Aang, Let's go meet him!,106,4.0
756,Sokka," He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.",106,8.0
757,Katara," Hello there, I'm Katara! What's your name?",106,7.0
758,Aang, Nice to meet you!,106,4.0
759,Katara, We just wanted to say “hi”.,106,6.0
760,Aang," Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere, maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market!",106,20.0
761,Katara, Which means no nuts for dinner! ,106,6.0
762,Sokka," Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts!  Yeh, I hate'em too.",106,12.0
763,Aang, Great hat. I'll trade you some nuts for it.,106,9.0
764,Katara, Hey!,106,1.0
765,Haru," Hi, mom.",106,2.0
766,Mother," Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores.",106,12.0
767,Katara," Hey, you're that kid! Why did you run away before?",106,10.0
768,Haru," Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.",106,10.0
769,Aang," No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending.",106,7.0
770,Mother, They saw you doing what?,106,5.0
771,Haru," They're crazy, mom, I mean, look at how they're dressed!",106,10.0
772,Mother, You know how dangerous that is! You know what would happen if they caught you earthbending!,106,16.0
773,Soldier, Open up!,106,2.0
774,Sokka, Fire Nation! Act natural!,106,4.0
775,Mother, What do you want? I've already paid you this week.,106,10.0
776,Soldier," Fire is sometimes so hard to control.  The tax just doubled. Wouldn't want an accident, would we?",106,17.0
777,Sokka, Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?,106,10.0
778,Mother, Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.,106,14.0
779,Haru," They're thugs; they steal from us, and everyone here is too much of a coward to do anything about it.",106,20.0
780,Mother," Quiet, Haru. Don't talk like that.",106,6.0
781,Katara," But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help.",106,7.0
782,Mother, Earthbending is forbidden. It's caused nothing but misery for this village. He must never use his abilities.,106,17.0
783,Katara, How can you say that? Haru has a gift. Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.,106,28.0
784,Mother, You don't understand.,106,3.0
785,Katara, I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?,106,22.0
786,Mother, They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.,106,10.0
787,Haru," My mom said you can sleep here tonight, but you should leave in the morning.",106,15.0
788,Aang, Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.,106,10.0
789,Katara, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.,106,13.0
790,Haru," That's ok. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store, it reminded me of him.",106,18.0
791,Katara, thanks.,106,1.0
792,Haru," My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one, but they fought back anyway.",106,25.0
793,Katara, He sounds like a great man.,106,6.0
794,Haru," After the attack, they rounded up my father every other earthbender and took them away. We haven't seen them since.",106,20.0
795,Katara," So, that's why you hide your earthbending?",106,7.0
796,Haru, Yeh. The problem is that the only way I can feel close to my father now is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.,106,28.0
797,Katara, See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.,106,9.0
798,Haru, It's beautiful.,106,2.0
799,Katara, I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.,106,18.0
800,Haru," It's not enough, is it?",106,5.0
801,Katara, No.,106,1.0

806,Haru, There's no time – pull harder.,106,6.0
807,Katara," Haru, there's a way you can help him.",106,8.0
808,Haru, I can't.,106,2.0
809,Katara," Haru, you did it!  Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way.",106,16.0
810,Aang, You must have really inspired him.,106,6.0
811,Katara, I guess so.,106,3.0
812,Sokka, Everyone should get some sleep. We're leaving at dawn.,106,9.0
813,Katara, Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?,106,7.0
814,Sokka," Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night.",106,24.0
815,Katara, I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.,106,6.0
816,Sokka, Good night.,106,2.0
817,Old Man, That's him! That's the earthbender!<u,106,5.0
818,Katara, They took him! They took Haru away!,106,7.0
819,Aang, What?,106,1.0
820,Katara," The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation. It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending.",106,19.0
821,Sokka," Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?",106,7.0
822,Katara, Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.,106,9.0
823,Sokka," Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.",106,10.0
824,Katara, We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.,106,17.0
825,Aang, ...and why would they do that?,106,6.0
826,Katara, because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.,106,8.0
827,Sokka," I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines, all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and – tada! Fake earthbending.",106,45.0
828,Katara, Aang. Did you get all that?,106,6.0
829,Aang," Sure, I got it.",106,4.0
830,Sokka, Do you remember your cue?,106,5.0
831,Aang," Yeh, yeh, just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.",106,12.0
832,Sokka, By “this” do you mean intentionally getting captured by an army of ruthless firebenders?,106,14.0
833,Aang, Exactly! That's fun stuff.,106,4.0
834,Sokka," Get out of my way, pipsqueak!  Here they come! Get in your places!",106,13.0
835,Katara, How dare you call me “pipsqueak” you giant-eared cretin!,106,9.0
836,Sokka, What did you call me?,106,5.0
837,Katara, A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things.  Do herds of animals use them for shade?,106,15.0
838,Sokka, You better back off!  Seriously – back off.,106,8.0
839,Katara, I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!,106,19.0
840,Sokka, That's it – you're going down!,106,6.0
841,Katara," I said, “earthbending style!”  I'll show you who's boss – earthbending style!",106,12.0
842,Soldier, That lemur! It's earthbending!,106,4.0
843,Sokka," No, you idiot! It's the girl!",106,6.0
844,Soldier," Oh, of course.",106,3.0
845,Sokka," Momo, you have some big ears!  I'll hold her!  You've got 12 hours to find Haru, we'll be right behind you.",106,21.0
846,Warden," What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him!? Take him below!  One week in solitary will improve his manners.  Simply treat me with the courtesy I give you and we'll get along famously. You will notice earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of metal. You are miles away from any rock or earth, so if you have any illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people, forget them. It is impossible. Good day.  Earthbenders, it is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard. I am your warden. I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, but as honored guests, and I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host. You will succeed here if you simply abide –",106,134.0

850,Katara, It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.,106,11.0
851,Haru," So, you got yourself arrested?",106,5.0
852,Katara, It was the only way to find you.,106,8.0
853,Haru," Katara, this is my father, Tyro. Dad, this is Katara.  You got guts, Katara, I'll give you that.  Come one, there's someone I want you to meet.",106,27.0
854,Katara, It's an honor to meet you.,106,6.0

859,Tyro, It's still pretty bad though.,106,5.0
860,Prisoner," Tyro, the prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.",106,12.0
861,Tyro," I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.",106,28.0

863,Tyro, Excuse me?,106,2.0
864,Katara," You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny? Sabotage?",106,15.0
865,Tyro, The plan? The plan is to survive - wait out this war. Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.,106,28.0
866,Katara, How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up.,106,12.0
867,Tyro," Katara, I admire your courage and I envy your youth, but people's lives are at stake here. The Warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless.",106,35.0
868,Katara," Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.  Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home. It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!  We'll see about that.",106,150.0

889,Aang, I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.  The Warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!,106,19.0
890,Sokka, Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?,106,8.0
891,Aang, I'm just tossing ideas around.,106,5.0
892,Katara," I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn't work. If there was just a way to help them help themselves.",106,23.0
893,Sokka," For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock... something they can bend.",106,15.0
894,Katara, But this entire place is made of metal.,106,8.0
895,Aang," No, it's not. Look at the smoke. I bet they're burning coal – In other words, earth.",106,17.0

897,Sokka," There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo, and the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go – right back here.  It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village.

903,Warden," Show no mercy!  Hahaha! Foolish girl! You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces.  There spirits were broken a long time ago. Oh? But you still believe in them?  How sweet. They're a waste of your energy, little girl. You've failed.",106,52.0

968,Aang," I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just... come to me.",107,17.0
969,Katara," I think you can do it, Aang.",107,7.0
970,Sokka," Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.",107,10.0
971,Iroh," A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one.  Ehh, seems I've dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.   Uh? Who's there?",107,32.0
972,Soldier, He's a Fire Nation soldier.,107,5.0
973,Captain," He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West, the once great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.",107,25.0
974,Aang," Hello? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm... here to try to help stuff.",107,18.0
975,Sokka, This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.,107,18.0
976,Old Man," If anyone can save us, he can.",107,7.0
977,Sokka, He still shouldn't have to face this alone.,107,8.0
978,Aang," Okay. Well, I guess that's settled then.<u  The sun has set. Where are you, Hei-Bai? Well, spirit, uh, I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace! ",107,29.0
979,Chief, The Avatar's methods are...  unusual.,107,5.0
980,Sokka, It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him?,107,15.0
981,Old Man," No, only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei-Bai.",107,10.0
982,Katara," Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.",107,10.0
983,Aang," I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge. Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now!  Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? ",107,32.0
984,Sokka, That's it! He needs help! ,107,5.0
985,Katara, Sokka wait!,107,2.0
986,Old Man, It's not safe!,107,3.0
987,Sokka, Hei-Bai! Over here!,107,3.0
988,Aang," Sokka, go back!",107,3.0
989,Sokka," We'll fight him together, Aang.",107,5.0
990,Aang, I don't wanna fight him unless I – huh!,107,9.0
991,Katara, Sokka!,107,1.0
992,Zuko," Uncle! Uncle, where are you?",107,5.0
993,Soldier," Sir, maybe he thought you left without him?",107,8.0
994,Zuko, Something's not right here.  That pile of rocks...,107,8.0
995,Soldier," It looks like there's been a landslide, sir.",107,8.0
996,Zuko, Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!,107,15.0
997,Sokka," Help!  Aang, over here!",107,4.0
998,Aang," Sokka!  I failed.  Hang on, Sokka!",107,6.0
999,Iroh, Where are you taking me?,107,5.0
1000,Captain, We're taking you to face justice.,107,6.0
1001,Iroh," Right. But where, specifically?",107,4.0
1002,Captain," A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.",107,23.0
1003,Iroh, Ah! The great city of Ba-Sing-Se.,107,6.0
1004,Captain," It was greater than you were, apparently.",107,7.0
1005,Iroh," I acknowledged my defeat at Ba-Sing-Se! After 600 days away from home, my men were tired and I was tired,  and I'm still tired.",107,24.0
1006,Old Man, I'm sure they'll be back.,107,5.0
1007,Katara, I know.,107,2.0
1008,Old Man, You should get some rest.,107,5.0
1009,Katara, Everything's gonna be okay.,107,4.0
1010,Old Man, Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him.,107,16.0
1011,Aang," Katara, Katara I lost him.",107,5.0
1012,Old Man, The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.,107,9.0
1013,Aang," I'm in the spirit world!  What? No, I'm right here! Grrr!!!",107,11.0
1014,Zuko," Yup, that's Uncle Iroh.",107,4.0
1015,Aang," Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here. But, I guess you can't see me either.  I'll figure this out, Katara, I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem!",107,51.0
1016,Katara," It's ok, Appa. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.",107,24.0
1017,Aang," Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?  What am I supposed to do?",107,14.0
1018,Captain, What's the problem?,107,3.0
1019,Iroh," Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are feeling sore and achy and these shackles are too loose.",107,23.0
1020,Captain, Too loose?,107,2.0
1021,Iroh, That's right. The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.,107,30.0
1022,Captain," Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's hand cuffs.",107,8.0
1023,Aang," I don't understand. This is just a statue of Roku.  Hey, what are you doing!? Ahhhh!!! ",107,16.0
1024,Soldier," He is too dangerous, Captain. We can't just carry him to the capital. We have to do something now.",107,19.0
1025,Captain, I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.,107,10.0
1026,Katara," It's no use, Appa. I don't see them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.",107,21.0
1027,Zuko, The Avatar!,107,2.0
1028,Katara, You're back! Where's Sokka?,107,4.0
1029,Aang, I'm not sure. ,107,3.0
1030,Captain, These dangerous hands must be crushed.,107,6.0
1031,Iroh," Excellent form, Prince Zuko.",107,4.0
1032,Zuko, You taught me well.,107,4.0
1033,Captain," Surrender yourselves, it's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.",107,9.0
1034,Iroh," Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!",107,8.0
1035,Zuko, Now would you please put on some clothes!,107,8.0
1036,Katara," Aang, what are you doing? Run!",107,6.0
1037,Aang, You're the spirit of this forest. Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned I was sad and upset. But my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.,107,43.0
1038,Katara, Sokka!,107,1.0
1039,Sokka, What happened?,107,2.0
1040,Katara, You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours. How are you feeling?,107,14.0
1041,Sokka, Like I seriously need to use the bathroom!,107,8.0
1042,Chief," Thank you, Avatar. If there only were a way to repay you for what you've done.",107,16.0
1043,Sokka, You could give us some supplies and some money.,107,9.0
1044,Katara, Sokka!,107,1.0
1045,Sokka, What? We need stuff.,107,4.0
1046,Chief, It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey. ,107,12.0
1047,Katara," I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do all on your own.",107,16.0
1048,Aang," Actually, I did have a little help. And there's something else. ",107,11.0
1049,Sokka, What is it?,107,3.0
1050,Aang, I need to talk to Roku and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit.,107,17.0
1051,Katara, That's great!,107,2.0
1052,Sokka," Creepy, but great.",107,3.0
1053,Aang," There's a temple on a crescent shaped island, and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him.",107,23.0
1054,Katara," But, the solstice is tomorrow.",107,5.0
1055,Aang," Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.",107,13.0
1056,Aang ," Let's go Appa! Come on, boy!",108,6.0
1057,Appa, GRRRRRRR,108,1.0
1058,Aang," Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself.  So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!",108,34.0
1059,Sokka, I think his big butt is trying to tell you something.,108,11.0
1060,Katara," Please don't go, Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.(",108,18.0
1061,Aang, But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means. I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today. ,108,32.0
1062,Katara," We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.",108,10.0
1063,Sokka, EWWWWW  At least not without your friends. We got your back.,108,11.0
1064,Chief, It's a long journey to the Crescent Island.  You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it befor/ie sundown. Good luck.,108,24.0
1065,Aang," Thank you, for your...",108,4.0
1066,Chief , Go!,108,1.0
1067,Zuko, Having trouble sleeping?  Seen the Avatar lately?,108,7.0
1068,Aang," Come on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster! ",108,11.0
1069,Iroh," Sailing into Fire Nation waters... of all the foolish things you have done in your 16 years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish.",108,24.0
1070,Zuko," I have no choice, Uncle.",108,5.0
1071,Iroh, Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you?!?!?  What if you're caught?,108,14.0
1072,Zuko, I'm chasing the Avatar. My father will understand why I'm returning home.,108,12.0
1073,Iroh, You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type.,108,13.0
1074,Zuko," There they are! Helmsman, full steam ahead!",108,7.0
1075,Katara," Aang, we got trouble.",108,4.0
1076,Sokka," Yeah, and its gaining fast!",108,5.0
1077,Iroh," Really, Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?",108,12.0
1078,Zuko, On my mark.........Fire!,108,3.0
1079,Katara, Fire ball!,108,2.0
1080,Aang, I'm on it! ,108,3.0
1081,Katara, We have to get out of Zuko's range before he shoots another hot stinker at us!,108,16.0
1082,Sokka, Can't you make Appa go any faster?,108,7.0
1083,Aang," Yeah, but there's just one little problem.",108,7.0
1084,Zuko, A blockade!,108,2.0
1085,Iroh, Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.,108,16.0
1086,Aang, If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade. It's the only way.,108,20.0
1087,Katara, There's no time.,108,3.0
1088,Aang, This is exactly why I didn't want you to come. Its too dangerous.,108,13.0
1089,Katara, And that's exactly why we're here.,108,6.0
1090,Sokka, Let's run this blockade.,108,4.0
1091,Aang, Appa! Yip! Yip!,108,3.0
1092,Zuko, He's not turning around.,108,4.0
1093,Iroh," Please Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do. Do not follow the Avatar.",108,20.0
1094,Zuko," I'm sorry, Uncle.  Run the blockade!",108,6.0
1095,Zhao, The Avatar...and the banished Prince. This must be my lucky day.,108,11.0
1096,Soldier," Commander Zhao, what are your orders?",108,6.0
1097,Zhao, Shoot the Bison down.,108,4.0
1098,Soldier," But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, Sir, one of our own. What if it's hit?",108,17.0
1099,Zhao, So be it.  It belongs to a traitor.  Ignite!  Launch!!!,108,10.0
1100,Aang, Appa! Are you ok?,108,4.0
1101,Appa, Grrrrrr!,108,1.0
1102,Engine Master," Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!",108,13.0
1103,Zuko, Do not stop this ship.,108,5.0
1104,Zhao, Ready......  Launch!,108,2.0
1105,Aang, We made it!!!,108,3.0
1106,Sokka, We got into the Fire Nation.........Great...,108,6.0
1107,Soldier," Where do you think the Avatar is headed, Sit?",108,9.0
1108,Zhao, I'm not sure.  But I bet a certain banished prince will know.(,108,12.0
1109,Iroh, We're on a collision course!,108,5.0
1110,Zuko, We can make it!,108,4.0
1111,Soldier," The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, Sir.",108,10.0
1112,Zhao, Wait. Cut the engines. Let them pass.,108,7.0
1113,Soldier, Sir?,108,1.0
1114,Aang, You did it buddy. Nice flying.  There it is! The island Roku's dragon took me to!,108,16.0
1115,Katara , Oh! You must be tired!,108,5.0
1116,Katara, I was talking to Appa.,108,5.0
1117,Sokka," I don't see any guards.  Well, I was talking to Momo.",108,11.0
1118,Katara, The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.,108,12.0
1119,Aang, Its almost sundown. We'd better hurry.,108,6.0
1120,Sokka, Wait......I think I heard something.,108,5.0
1121,Fire Sage, We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.,108,12.0
1122,Aang, Great! I am the Avatar.,108,5.0
1123,Fire Sage, We know.,108,2.0
1124,Aang, I'll hold them off. Run!,108,5.0
1125,Fire Sage," If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become. Split up and find him!",108,19.0
1126,Aang, Follow me!,108,2.0
1127,Sokka, Do you know where you're going?,108,6.0
1128,Aang, Nope!  Wrong way!,108,3.0
1129,Shyu, I don't want to fight you. I am a friend.  Come back!(,108,12.0
1130,Sokka, Firebenders aren't our friends.,108,4.0
1131,Shyu," I know why you're here, Avatar.",108,6.0
1132,Aang, You do?,108,2.0
1133,Shyu, Yes.  You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.,108,14.0
1134,Aang, How?,108,1.0
1135,Shyu , This way.,108,2.0
1136,Shyu, Time is running out. Quickly!,108,5.0
1137,Zuko," What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?",108,11.0
1138,Iroh, Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after...the Avatar.,108,18.0
1139,Zuko," If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.",108,17.0
1140,Shyu, Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.,108,17.0
1141,Aang, Did you know Avatar Roku?,108,5.0
1142,Shyu, No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.,108,27.0
1143,Aang, Is that how you knew I was coming?,108,8.0
1144,Shyu," A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku, its eyes...began to glow!",108,17.0
1145,Katara, That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too! ,108,15.0
1146,Shyu," At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.",108,11.0
1147,Aang," If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me?",108,12.0
1148,Shyu," Things have changed. In the past, the Sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the Sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.",108,31.0
1149,Aang, They were waiting for me.,108,5.0
1150,Sokka," Hey, don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late.",108,10.0
1151,Shyu," They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozen began the war, my grandfather and the other Sages were forced to follow him.  I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other Sages.",108,50.0
1152,Aang, Thank you for helping me.,108,5.0
1153,Shyu," NO!  We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.  Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him.",108,30.0
1154,Aang," Shyu, what's wrong?",108,3.0
1155,Shyu," The sanctuary doors, they're closed.",108,5.0
1156,Katara, Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?,108,13.0
1157,Shyu, No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise the Sages must open the doors together with five simultaneous fire blasts.,108,27.0
1158,Sokka," Five fire blasts, huh? ( I think I can help you out.",108,12.0
1159,Zuko," Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover.",108,17.0
1160,Iroh, Hmmmm,108,1.0
1161,Sokka," This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and tada! Fake firebending!",108,31.0
1162,Katara," You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.",108,7.0
1163,Shyu," The Sages will hear the explosions, so as soon as they go off, you rush in.  This might actually work.",108,20.0
1164,Katara, Its almost sunset. Are you ready?,108,6.0
1165,Aang, They're still locked.  Definitely.,108,4.0
1166,Shyu, It didn't work.,108,3.0
1167,Aang, Why won't it open! Aargh!,108,5.0
1168,Katara," Aang, stop! There's nothing else we can do.",108,8.0
1169,Aang, I'm sorry I put you through all this for nothing.,108,10.0
1170,Sokka, I don't get it. That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.,108,14.0
1171,Katara, Sokka! You're a genius!,108,4.0
1172,Aang," Wait, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work.",108,10.0
1173,Sokka," Come on Aang, let her dream.",108,6.0
1174,Katara, You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work...but it looks like it did.,108,11.0
1175,Aang, Did the definition of “genius” change in the last hundred years? ,108,11.0
1176,Shyu, Hurry! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary.,108,7.0
1177,Fire Sage, How did he get in?,108,5.0
1178,Shyu, I don't know. But look at the scorch marks and down there!,108,12.0
1179,Fire Sage, It's the Avatar's lemur! He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!  He's inside. Open the doors immediately before he contacts Avatar Roku.,108,25.0
1180,Shyu," Now, Aang!",108,2.0
1181,Katara, Aang! Now's your chance!,108,4.0
1182,Zuko, Close the doors! Quickly!  The Avatar's coming with me!,108,9.0
1183,Katara, He made it!  Go!,108,4.0
1184,Aang, The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?,108,15.0
1185,Zuko, Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!,108,7.0
1186,Fire Sage, It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.,108,12.0
1187,Aang," Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me!",108,21.0
1188,Roku," It's good to see you, Aang. What took you so long?",108,11.0
1189,Zuko, Why did you help the Avatar?,108,6.0
1190,Shyu, Because it was once the Sages' duty. It is still our duty. ,108,12.0
1191,Zhao, What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him.,108,20.0
1192,Fire Sage , Commander Zhao...,108,2.0
1193,Zhao," And Prince Zuko, it was a noble effort. But your little smoke screen didn't work. Two traitors, in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.",108,26.0
1194,Zuko," You're too late, Zhao. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.",108,12.0
1195,Zhao," No matter. Sooner or later, he has to come out.",108,10.0
1196,Roku," I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the spirit world, I sent my dragon to find you.",108,26.0
1197,Aang, Is it about that vision? The one with the comet?,108,10.0
1198,Roku, Yes.,108,1.0
1199,Aang, What does it mean?,108,4.0
1200,Roku," One hundred years ago, Fire Lord Sozen used that comet to begin the war. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations. ",108,33.0
1201,Aang, So the comet made them stronger?,108,6.0
1202,Roku, Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.,108,7.0
1203,Aang, But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the war now? ,108,18.0
1204,Roku," Listen carefully.  Sozen's comet will return by the end of the summer. And Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all.  If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord before the comet arrives.",108,54.0
1205,Aang," But I haven't even started learning waterbending, not to mention earth and fire.",108,13.0
1206,Roku," Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end.",108,23.0
1207,Zhao," When those doors open, unleash all your firebending power.",108,9.0
1208,Katara, How's Aang going to make it out of this?,108,9.0
1209,Sokka, How're we going to make it out of this?,108,9.0
1210,Aang, What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?,108,14.0
1211,Roku," I know you can do it Aang, for you have done it before. The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways...for now.",108,24.0
1212,Aang, But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you? ,108,22.0
1213,Roku," I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way.  A great danger awaits you at the temple.  I can help you face the threat.  But only if you are ready.",108,40.0
1214,Aang, I'm ready. ,108,2.0
1215,Zhao, Ready...,108,1.0
1216,Katara, No! Aang!,108,2.0
1217,Zhao, Fire!(,108,1.0
1218,Shyu, Avatar Roku's going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!  Avatar Roku!,108,16.0
1219,Katara, Not without Aang!,108,3.0
1220,Sokka, We got your back.,108,4.0
1221,Aang, Thanks. Where's Shyu?,108,3.0
1222,Katara, I don't know.,108,3.0
1223,Zhao, No prince. No Avatar. Apparently the only thing I do have is five traitors.,108,14.0
1224,Fire Sage," But Commander, only Shyu helped the Avatar.",108,7.0
1225,Zhao," Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you're all guilty! Take them to the prison hold!",108,21.0
1226,Sokka, Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you'll go flying off! What's bugging you anyway?,109,17.0
1227,Aang, It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.,109,16.0
1228,Sokka," Well, let's see, you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years... I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.",109,26.0
1229,Aang, I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole! What am I gonna do!?,109,19.0
1230,Katara," Calm down. It's going to be okay. If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know.",109,22.0
1231,Aang, You'd do that?,109,3.0
1232,Katara, We'll need to find a good source of water first.,109,10.0
1233,Sokka, Nice puddle.  Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.,109,13.0
1234,Aang," Yehhh! Don't start without me, boy!",109,6.0
1235,Katara, Remember the reason we're here.,109,5.0
1236,Aang," Oh right, time to practice waterbending. ",109,6.0
1237,Sokka, Great. So what am I supposed to do?,109,8.0
1238,Aang, You could... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes?,109,9.0
1239,Sokka," So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet?",109,25.0
1240,Aang, Mud and bugs!,109,3.0
1241,Sokka, Okay.,109,1.0
1242,Zuko, What's the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!  Someone's changing our course!,109,17.0
1243,Iroh," Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.",109,15.0
1244,Zuko, Is it something to do with the Avatar?,109,8.0
1245,Iroh, Even more urgent. It seems... I've lost my lotus tile.,109,10.0
1246,Zuko, Lotus tile?,109,2.0
1247,Iroh," For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.",109,23.0
1248,Zuko, You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile? ,109,9.0
1249,Iroh," I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.  See, you, like most people, underestimate its value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!",109,46.0
1250,Sokka," Yeh, don't get too happy. You gotta do me next.",109,10.0
1251,Katara," The key is getting the wrist movement right.  This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect, so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away. Just push and pull the water like this... ",109,41.0
1252,Aang, Like this?,109,2.0
1253,Katara," That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually – ",109,11.0
1254,Aang," Hey, I'm bending it already!",109,5.0
1255,Katara," Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.  It took me two months to learn that move.",109,18.0
1256,Aang," Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.",109,18.0
1257,Katara, Thanks.,109,1.0
1258,Aang," So, what's next.",109,3.0
1259,Katara," It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if...  This is a more difficult move. I call it ""streaming the water.""",109,22.0
1260,Aang," Sorry. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!",109,7.0
1261,Katara," Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave...",109,29.0
1262,Aang," So, like this?",109,3.0
1263,Sokka, Aang!,109,1.0
1264,Aang, Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got?,109,13.0
1265,Katara, That's enough practicing for today.,109,5.0
1266,Sokka," Yeh, I'll say!  You just practiced our supplies down the river!",109,11.0
1267,Aang, Uhhh... sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.,109,13.0
1268,Sokka," We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.  Ugh, it was hard enough when you were just an airbender.",109,30.0
1269,Aang," Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!",109,14.0
1270,Sokka," It doesn't even work.  See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.",109,13.0
1271,Katara," No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.",109,11.0
1272,Pirate Barker," Oh! You there! I can see by your clothing that you're world traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?  Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here! Don't be shy, come one by!",109,45.0
1273,Aang, Sure! What are curios?,109,4.0
1274,Pirate Barker," I'm not entirely sure, but we got'em!",109,7.0
1275,Pirate Captain," I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur. That beast would fetch me a hefty sum, if you'd be interested in bartering.",109,23.0
1276,Aang, Momo's not for sale.,109,4.0
1277,Katara," Look at this, Aang! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves!",109,13.0
1278,Aang, Where did you get a waterbending scroll?,109,7.0
1279,Pirate Captain, Let's just say I got it up north at a most reasonable price. Free!,109,14.0
1280,Sokka, Waaait a minute...sea-loving traders...with suspiciously acquired merchandise...and pet reptile birds...You guys are pirates!,109,13.0
1281,Pirate Barker, We prefer to think of ourselves as high risk traders.,109,10.0
1282,Katara," So, how much for the, uh, ""traded"" scroll?",109,8.0
1283,Pirate Captain," I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom. Unless, of course, you kids have 200 gold pieces on ya right now?",109,24.0
1284,Aang," I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle. . Watch and learn.  What say to the price of... one copper piece!",109,26.0
1285,Pirate Captain, Hahaha! The price is 200 gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.,109,14.0
1286,Aang, Okay – two copper pieces!,109,5.0
1287,Pirate Captain," It's not as amusing the second time, boy.",109,8.0
1288,Katara," Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks.",109,14.0
1289,Aang," What was that all about, Katara.  Aye, we be castin' off now!",109,12.0
1290,Sokka," Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.",109,11.0
1291,Katara, I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.,109,12.0
1292,Pirate Barker," Hey you, get back here!",109,5.0
1293,Aang," Well, well, look who's come to their senses. Told ya the haggling would pay off.<u",109,15.0
1294,Katara, I...I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us!,109,11.0
1295,Random Pirate, Get back here!,109,3.0
1296,Pirate Barker, This way! Let's cut'em off!,109,5.0
1297,Cabbage Merchant, My cabbages!  This place is worse than Omashu!,109,8.0
1298,Random Pirate, I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!,109,9.0
1299,Pirate Barker," Now, who gets to take the steel of my blade first?",109,11.0
1300,Aang, Hold on tight!  No thanks!,109,5.0
1301,Katara," Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!",109,10.0
1302,Aang," I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.  Just hang on!",109,16.0
1303,Katara," I know, that's why I took – this!",109,8.0
1304,Aang, No way.,109,2.0
1305,Katara, Isn't it great?,109,3.0
1306,Sokka, No wonder they were trying to hack us up. You stole their waterbending scroll.,109,14.0
1307,Katara," I prefer to think of it as ""high-risk trading.""",109,9.0
1308,Aang," Haha! Good one, Katara.",109,4.0
1309,Katara," Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender.",109,14.0
1310,Sokka," It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!",109,20.0
1311,Katara, These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending.,109,16.0
1312,Sokka, Whatever.,109,1.0
1313,Aang," Well, what's done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from it.",109,15.0
1314,Iroh, I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.,109,16.0
1315,Zuko, It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone!,109,14.0
1316,Iroh," Quite the contrary. I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for, is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!",109,28.0
1317,Zuko, You bought a sumki horn?,109,5.0
1318,Iroh," This place looks promising!  For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.",109,17.0
1319,Pirate Barker, We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with.,109,15.0
1320,Zuko," This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?",109,10.0
1321,Katara," ""The single water whip""... looks doable.  I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours. ",109,20.0
1322,Sokka," I'm sorry, but you deserve that.  You've been duped. She's only interested in teaching herself.",109,15.0
1323,Katara, Why can't I get this stupid move!  Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip!,109,19.0
1324,Aang," You just gotta shift your weight through the stances...  There. See, the key to bending is...  You'll get it.",109,19.0
1325,Katara," Omigosh, Aang, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me. But, you know what, it won't happen again.  Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.  Will you PLEASE shut your air hole! Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes. Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!  What? ",109,68.0
1326,Aang," It's okay, Katara",109,3.0
1327,Sokka, What about Momo? He's the real victim here.,109,8.0
1328,Katara, I'm sorry Momo.,109,3.0
1329,Sokka, And... what about me? There was that time you – ,109,10.0
1330,Katara, No more apologies!,109,3.0
1331,Pirate Captain, Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?,109,7.0
1332,Zuko," We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?",109,11.0
1333,Pirate Captain, Uh huh.,109,2.0
1334,Zuko, Then they'll be on the water.,109,6.0
1335,Katara," Shoot! Come on water, work with me here!  Shh! Momo, go back to sleep.",109,14.0
1336,Zuko, Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.  I'll save you from the pirates.<u,109,19.0
1337,Katara, Go jump in the river!,109,5.0
1338,Zuko," Try to understand, I need to capture to restore something I've lost. My honor. Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost.",109,23.0
1339,Katara, My mother's necklace! How did you get that?,109,8.0
1340,Zuko," I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is.",109,14.0
1341,Katara, No!,109,1.0
1342,Pirate Captain, Enough of this necklace garbage. You promised the scroll!,109,9.0
1343,Zuko," I wonder how much money this is worth? . A lot, apparently. Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back and everyone goes home happy. Search the woods for the boy and meet back here.",109,39.0
1344,Pirate Captain, Fine.,109,1.0
1345,Sokka, Huh? Where did she go?  I don't believe it.,109,9.0
1346,Aang, What's wrong.,109,2.0
1347,Sokka, She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep –,109,23.0
1348,Random Pirate," I got him, come on!",109,5.0
1349,Sokka," Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap?",109,8.0
1350,Zuko, Nice work.,109,2.0
1351,Katara," Aang, this is all my fault.",109,6.0
1352,Aang," No, Katara it isn't.",109,4.0
1353,Iroh," Yeh, it kind of is.",109,5.0
1354,Zuko, Give me the boy.,109,4.0
1355,Pirate Captain, You give us the scroll.,109,5.0
1356,Sokka, You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment!?,109,13.0
1357,Zuko, Don't listen to him! He's trying to turn us against each other.,109,12.0
1358,Pirate Captain, Your friend is the Avatar?,109,5.0
1359,Sokka," Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market then that fancy scroll.",109,18.0
1360,Zuko," Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant!",109,7.0
1361,Aang," Yeh, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth...",109,8.0
1362,Sokka," I'm just sayin', it's bad business sense. Just imagine how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life!",109,26.0
1363,Pirate Captain, Keep the scroll! We can buy a hundred with the reward we will get for the kid.,109,17.0
1364,Zuko, You'll regret breaking a deal with me!,109,7.0
1365,Katara," Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples.",109,9.0

1372,Aang, A team of rhinos... or two waterbenders.,109,7.0
1373,Katara, Everybody in!,109,2.0
1374,Iroh, Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?,109,14.0
1375,Zuko," We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!",109,8.0
1376,Iroh, It's no proverb.,109,3.0
1377,Pirate Captain, Bleeding hog-monkeys! ,109,2.0
1378,Zuko, Hey! That's my boat!   Haha!,109,5.0
1379,Iroh, Maybe it should be a proverb.,109,6.0
1380,Zuko," Come on, Uncle!",109,3.0
1381,Aang, Sokka! Can't you make it go any faster?,109,8.0
1382,Sokka, I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the water tribe.,109,12.0
1383,Aang," Hey, you did the water whip!",109,6.0
1384,Katara, I couldn't have done it without your help!,109,8.0

1387,Katara," Aang, look!",109,2.0
1388,Aang," Oh, no!",109,2.0
1389,Sokka, Have you lost your mind!? This is no time for flute practice!,109,12.0
1390,Katara," It's working! It's slowing down!  We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water!",109,17.0
1391,Sokka, But we have another problem!,109,5.0
1392,Aang," I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, Appa.",109,11.0
1393,Sokka," Yeh, we owe ya one.",109,5.0
1394,Zuko, My boat!,109,2.0
1395,Iroh," Hehe, Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. The missing lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!",109,24.0
1396,Katara," Aang, I still owe you an apology.  You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger. I'm sorry.",109,30.0
1397,Aang," That's okay, Katara.",109,3.0
1398,Katara," Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway.",109,7.0
1399,Sokka, Is that really how you feel?,109,6.0
1400,Katara, The scroll!,109,2.0
1401,Sokka," First, what did you learn?",109,5.0
1402,Katara, Stealing is wrong.  Unless it's from pirates!,109,7.0
1403,Aang," Haha! Good one, Katara.",109,4.0

1405,Sokka, This is gonna take forever.,110,5.0
1406,Aang, That works...,110,2.0

1408,Katara, What?,110,1.0
1409,Aang, Why wouldn't we fly?,110,4.0
1410,Sokka, Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa—he's just too noticeable.,110,21.0
1411,Katara, What! Appa's not too noticeable!,110,5.0
1412,Sokka, He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head—it's kinda hard to miss him!,110,16.0
1413,Aang, Sokka's just jealous ‘cause he doesn't have an arrow.,110,9.0
1414,Sokka," I know you all want to fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.",110,21.0
1415,Katara, Who made you the boss?,110,5.0
1416,Sokka, I'm not the boss—I'm the leader.,110,6.0
1417,Katara, You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!,110,8.0
1418,Sokka, I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior.  So...I'm the leader!,110,10.0
1419,Katara," If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.",110,12.0
1420,Sokka, Are you kidding—he's just a goofy kid! ,110,7.0
1421,Aang, He's right.,110,2.0
1422,Katara, Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.,110,23.0
1423,Sokka, I-I've kissed a girl—you...just haven't met her.,110,7.0
1424,Katara, Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran.,110,5.0
1425,Sokka," No—besides Gran-gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts.",110,25.0
1426,Katara," Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.",110,9.0
1427,Aang, Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?  Who knows—walking might be fun.,110,16.0
1428,Katara, I don't know Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts—they seem to know everything.,110,14.0
1429,Sokka, Ha ha. Very funny.,110,4.0
1430,Aang, I'm tired of carrying this pack.,110,6.0
1431,Katara, You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts!,110,14.0
1432,Aang," That's a great idea! Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind—",110,10.0
1433,Sokka," RUN!  Okay, okay—I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that--  --we're safe from...the—  --Fire...Nation...",110,20.0

1435,Sokka," If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.",110,11.0
1436,Katara, What are you doing?,110,4.0
1437,Sokka, Bluffing?,110,1.0
1438,Captain, You? Promise not to hurt us?,110,6.0

1455,Katara, Um...thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.,110,11.0
1456,Jet, I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning—we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys stumbled in.,110,25.0
1457,Katara, We were relying on instincts.,110,5.0
1458,Jet, You'll get yourself killed doing that.,110,6.0
1459,The Duke, Hey Jet—these barrels are filled with blasting jelly.,110,8.0
1460,Jet, That's a great score. ,110,4.0
1461,Pipsqueak, And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!,110,8.0
1462,Jet, Also good. Let's not get those mixed up.,110,8.0

1475,Katara, It's beautiful up here!,110,4.0
1476,Jet, It's beautiful...and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us.,110,10.0
1477,Smellerbee," They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?",110,9.0
1478,Jet," It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.",110,5.0
1479,Katara, Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?,110,9.0
1480,Jet," I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble. See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.",110,25.0
1481,Pipsqueak," We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines, and doing anything we can to mess with ‘em. ",110,19.0

1485,Katara, Don't pay any attention to my brother.,110,7.0
1486,Jet, No problem. He probably had a rough day.,110,8.0
1487,Katara," So, you all live here?",110,5.0
1488,Jet, That's right. Longshot over there?  His town got burned down by the fire Nation. And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.,110,33.0
1489,Katara, What about you?,110,3.0
1490,Jet, Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.,110,16.0
1491,Katara, Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.,110,10.0
1492,Jet," Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.  I'm so sorry, Katara.",110,14.0
1493,Katara," Hey Jet, nice speech.",110,4.0
1494,Jet," Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That was some great bending I saw out there today.",110,22.0
1495,Katara," Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training. ",110,12.0
1496,Jet, Avatar huh? Very nice.,110,4.0
1497,Aang, Thanks Jet.,110,2.0
1498,Jet, So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.,110,15.0
1499,Sokka, Unfortunately we have to leave tonight. ,110,6.0
1500,Jet," Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.",110,12.0
1501,Sokka, What mission?,110,2.0
1502,Jet, What are you doing?,110,4.0
1503,Sokka, Shh...it amplifies vibrations.,110,3.0
1504,Jet, Good trick.,110,2.0
1505,Sokka," Nothing yet.  Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.",110,6.0
1506,Jet, How many?,110,2.0
1507,Sokka, I think there's just one.,110,5.0
1508,Jet," Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.",110,6.0
1509,Sokka, Wait! False alarm...he's just an old man.,110,7.0
1510,Jet," What are you doing in our woods, you leech.",110,9.0
1511,Old Man," Please sir, I'm just a traveler.",110,6.0
1512,Jet, Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?!,110,12.0
1513,Old Man, Oh...please let me go...have mercy...,110,5.0
1514,Jet, Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have mercy?!,110,13.0
1515,Sokka," Jet, he's just an old man!",110,6.0
1516,Jet, He's Fire Nation! Search him!,110,5.0
1517,Sokka, But he's not hurting anyone!,110,5.0
1518,Jet, Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!,110,14.0
1519,Smellerbee," We've got his stuff, Jet. ",110,5.0
1520,Sokka, This doesn't feel right.,110,4.0

1524,Sokka, Yeah—he's back. But we're leaving.,110,5.0
1525,Aang, What?,110,1.0
1526,Katara, But I made him this hat.,110,6.0
1527,Sokka, Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.,110,5.0
1528,Katara," What? No, he's not.",110,4.0
1529,Sokka, He's messed up Katara.,110,4.0
1530,Aang," He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life—a really fun way of life.",110,17.0
1531,Sokka, He beat and robbed a harmless old man!,110,8.0
1532,Katara, I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.,110,8.0
1533,Jet, Sokka—you told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?,110,15.0
1534,Katara," No, he conveniently left that part out.",110,7.0
1535,Sokka," Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian",110,13.0
1536,Jet," See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. . He was sent to eliminate me—you helped save my life, Sokka.  He was an assassin, Sokka. ",110,26.0
1537,Katara, I knew there was an explanation,110,6.0
1538,Sokka, I didn't see any knife!,110,5.0
1539,Jet, That's because he was concealing it.,110,6.0
1540,Katara, See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.,110,10.0
1541,Sokka, There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. ,110,14.0
1542,Jet, Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.,110,12.0
1543,Aang, What can we do?,110,4.0
1544,Jet," The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.",110,35.0
1545,Katara, We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!,110,14.0
1546,Sokka," I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.",110,11.0
1547,Katara, You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!,110,16.0
1548,Sokka," Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct—",110,11.0
1549,Katara, Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang.,110,19.0
1550,Aang, Sorry Sokka.,110,2.0
1551,Jet," Now listen—you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.  Let's go.",110,26.0
1552,Duke, But what about the people in the town—won't they get wiped out too?,110,13.0
1553,Jet," Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. ",110,13.0
1554,, Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal—got it?,110,11.0
1555,Smellerbee," Where do you think you're going, ponytail?<u",110,7.0
1556,Jet, Sokka. I'm glad you decided to join us.,110,8.0
1557,Sokka, I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.,110,10.0
1558,Jet, Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.,110,11.0
1559,Sokka, There are people living there Jet—mothers and fathers and children.,110,10.0
1560,Jet, We can't win without making some sacrifices.,110,7.0
1561,Sokka, You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!,110,10.0
1562,Jet, Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.,110,14.0
1563,Sokka, I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.,110,16.0

1566,Sokka, Right...got it.,111,2.0
1567,Katara,"  Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on TOP of the tent. You know, so we don't get RAINED on.",111,20.0
1568,Sokka," Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.",111,21.0
1569,Katara, But what if it DOES rain?,111,6.0
1570,Sokka,  But what if it doesn't? Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing.,111,15.0
1571,Katara,  Ur...arg! You're infuriating!,111,3.0
1572,Sokka," Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood because that kindling's looking PRETTY sorry.",111,15.0
1573,Katara,  Well if you don't like my firewood... have it!,111,9.0
1574,Sokka, Fine by me! If you're not going to do your job  ...urg!,111,12.0
1575,Aang," Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the...  Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?",111,20.0
1576,Sokka,  Why don't you ask Miss Know It All? Queen of the Twigs!,111,12.0
1577,Katara,"  Oh yeah?  Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the  ...Tents!",111,11.0
1578,Aang," Okay, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?",111,16.0
1579,Katara, ) Sounds good.,111,3.0
1580,Sokka,  Whatever.,111,1.0
1581,Aang," Come on Momo, that's fair.  Appa's got FIVE stomachs.   You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the Avatar.",111,25.0
1582,Katara, Wow! I could just stare at it forever.,111,8.0
1583,Sokka,  Okay. I've seen enough.,111,4.0
1584,Katara," How can you not be fascinated, Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.",111,16.0
1585,Sokka, Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.,111,18.0
1586,Scout,"  Hey! If you're looking for the Canyon Guide, I was here first!",111,12.0
1587,Katara, Ooooo...canyon guide. Sounds informative.,111,4.0

1589,Sokka," Calm down, we know you're next.",111,6.0
1590,Scout,  You wouldn't be calm if the Fire Nation destroyed YOUR home and forced YOU to flee.  My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se!,111,33.0
1591,Katara, You're a refugee.,111,3.0
1592,Scout, Humph. Tell me somethin' I don't know.,111,7.0
1593,Katara, Is that your tribe?,111,4.0
1594,Scout, That's the Zhang tribe. A bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for 100 years. Hey Zhangs! I'm savin' a spot for my tribe so don't even THINK of stealing it!  It most certainly is NOT. ,111,40.0
1595,Zhang Leader, Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their campsite?,111,13.0
1596,Scout,  Yes! But they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.,111,12.0
1597,Zhang Leader, I didn't know the canyon Guide took reservations.,111,8.0
1598,Scout, Heh! Of course you didn't. That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang! So unorganized and ill prepared for a journey.,111,22.0
1599,Canyon Guide," Sorry about the wait, youngsters.  Who's ready to cross this here canyon?",111,12.0
1600,Katara, Um... one of them I think.,111,6.0
1601,Scout, I was here first! My party's on their way!,111,9.0
1602,Canyon Guide, I can't guide people who aren't here.,111,7.0
1603,Zhang Leader,  Guess you guys'll have to make the trip tomorrow.,111,9.0
1604,Scout, Wait! Here they come!,111,4.0
1605,Zhang Leader,"  You're not seriously going to cave into these spoiled Gan Jins! I mean, we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter.",111,24.0
1606,Canyon Guide,  I...uh...well...,111,1.0
1607,Scout, We've got old people who are weary from traveling.,111,9.0
1608,Zhang Leader, Sick people get priority over old people.,111,7.0
1609,Gan Jin Leader, Maybe you Zhang's wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.,111,14.0
1610,Zhang Leader," If you Gan Jins weren't so clean,  maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.",111,15.0
1611,Gan Jin Leader, I could smell your stink a mile away.,111,8.0
1612,Katara,"  Well Aang, ready to put your peace making skills to the test?",111,12.0
1613,Aang,  I... don't know. A fight over chores is one thing. These people have been feuding for 100 years.,111,18.0
1614,Katara,"  Everyone, listen up! This is the Avatar! And if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.",111,28.0
1615,Aang, Uh...you could share the earthbender and travel together?,111,8.0
1616,Gan Jin Leader, Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation  than travel with those stinking thieves.,111,16.0
1617,Zhang Leader, We wouldn't travel with you pompous fools anyway!,111,8.0
1618,Gan Jin Leader,  I am not pompous!,111,4.0
1619,Aang, Sorry Appa. You'll have to do this on your own.   Alright! Here's the deal! We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across. Does that seem fair?,111,33.0
1620,Sokka, This feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?,111,18.0
1621,Aang," To tell the truth, I'm not sure.  But when have I ever been?",111,13.0
1622,Katara,"  He's the Avatar, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job.",111,11.0
1623,Sokka,"  His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?",111,13.0
1624,Canyon Guide," Okay, now comes the bad news.  No food allowed in the canyon. It attracts dangerous predators.",111,16.0
1625,Gan Jin Leader, No food! This is ridiculous.,111,5.0
1626,Canyon Guide," Now, we're headin' down in 10 minutes. All food better be in your gut, or in the garbage!  Aww, you babies can go a day without food. Would you rather be hungry...or dead?",111,33.0
1627,Aang," Nice bending!  Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there.  See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip!",111,22.0
1628,Canyon Guide," Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by Earth Spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice.  The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. ",111,48.0
1629,Aang, Why'd you do that?,111,4.0
1630,Canyon Guide," These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? I gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now.",111,21.0
1631,Sokka, Okay...now you gotta help me!  We gotta help him!,111,9.0
1632,Aang, What was that?,111,3.0
1633,Canyon Guide," Canyon crawler. Oh, ugh! And there's sure to be more.",111,10.0
1634,Katara, Your arms...they're broken.,111,3.0

1636,Aang, ...we're trapped in this canyon.<u,111,5.0
1637,Sokka, I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like... canyon crawlers...,111,21.0
1638,Gan Jin Leader," It's the Zhangs! They took food down here, even after the guide told them not to!",111,16.0
1639,Zhang Leader," What! If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins! ",111,17.0
1640,Gan Jin Leader, I hope you're happy. We're stuck in the canyon with no way out.,111,13.0
1641,Zhang Leader," Why don't you thank yourself, food hider! ",111,7.0
1642,Aang, Look. Sticking together is the only way to...,111,8.0

1645,Aang,  Any ideas?,111,2.0
1646,Canyon Guide, No bending. We need to get out of this canyon. I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!,111,23.0
1647,Gan Jin Leader, See? We're going to become part of the food chain because of YOU!,111,13.0
1648,Zhang Leader, Sure. Unjustly blame the Zhangs like you ALWAYS do!,111,9.0
1649,Gan Jin Leader, Gladly!,111,1.0
1650,Aang," We should split up. Gan Jins on this side...and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines.  ENOUGH!  I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not going to happen. ",111,37.0
1651,Sokka," So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?",111,10.0
1652,Zhang Leader, What for? It's the dry season.,111,6.0
1653,Sokka,  Exactly!,111,1.0
1654,Zhang Leader,"  Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.",111,10.0
1655,Sokka," Finally, someone gets it.",111,4.0
1656,Katara, You really think it'll rain?,111,5.0
1657,Gan Jin Leader," Would you care for some bread, Katara?  No, but you can never be too careful, right?",111,16.0
1658,Katara, So it was you guys who had food!,111,8.0
1659,Gan Jin Leader, Oh come now. You really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should MY people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces? ,111,27.0
1660,Katara,"  Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much?",111,19.0
1661,Gan Jin Leader," The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty; transporting our sacred orb from the Great Eastern Gate to the Great Western Gate.  You seem like a smart girl, Katara. I bet you would enjoy hearing some history.",111,46.0
1662,Zhang Leader, Care for some meat?,111,4.0
1663,Sokka, Would I!?,111,2.0
1664,Zhang Leader, I know what you must be thinking. We're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.,111,17.0
1665,Sokka,  Mm hmm!,111,2.0
1666,Zhang Leader, The Gan Jin think so badly of us they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.,111,28.0
1667,Sokka,  Mmmm!,111,1.0
1668,Zhang Leader," Our forefather, Wei Jin, was leaving the western gate of our village...  Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years...",111,24.0
1669,Sokka, That's just terrible.  You gonna finish that?,111,7.0
1670,Aang," Nah, I'll wait for the leechy nuts.  Sure would be nice to be around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing.  It's okay, Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts!",111,42.0
1671,Canyon Guide,"  It's lonely, isn't it?  Being impartial.",111,6.0

1673,Canyon Guide, All clear!  We're almost to the other side.   I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated. ,111,17.0
1674,Aang," Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?",111,14.0
1675,Katara,"  I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb.",111,21.0
1676,Aang, What are you talking about?,111,5.0
1677,Sokka," Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about? We Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.",111,29.0
1678,Katara,  Not punished enough if you ask me!,111,7.0
1679,Aang," Please everyone! As soon as we get out of here we can eat, and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.  Okay! Okay! I get it! Now I need your help. Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. ",111,58.0

The sacred orb from the legend  ...that was the ball. And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts . Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Win Jei didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal. But he stepped out of bounds , so the official put him in the penalty box, not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes.   No!  I mean I really knew them. I may not look it, but I'm 112 years old. I was there a hundred years ago on the day you're talking about...",111,155.0

2393,Superior, Avatar! You must leave!,115,4.0
2394,Aang," Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.",115,8.0
2395,Superior, A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.,115,11.0

2404,Zuko, How stupid do you think I am?,115,7.0
2405,Sokka, Pretty stupid.  Run!,115,3.0
2406,Zuko, What are we supposed to do now?,115,7.0
2407,June, It's seeking a different scent – perhaps something that the Avatar held.,115,12.0
2408,Zuko, What's it doing? It's just going around in a circle!,115,10.0

2422,Katara, And we need you.,115,4.0
2423,Aang," I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you –",115,17.0
2424,Katara, I'll be okay.,115,3.0
2425,Aang," Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like...this!",115,8.0
2426,Katara ," Aang, how did you get that? ",115,6.0
2427,Aang , Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you.,115,10.0
2428,Katara ," Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko. Would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?",115,18.0
2429,Aang, Sure!,115,1.0
2430,Katara, This should give us a good idea of what's around here.,116,11.0
2431,Sokka ," See if you can find a menu, I'm starving.",116,9.0
2432,Aang," I bet we'll find something to eat here! . The Fire Days Festival.  Fire Nation cultural exhibits...jugglers, benders, magicians. This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!",116,31.0
2433,Sokka , You might wanna rethink that. Look at this.,116,8.0
2434,Aang," Hey, a poster of me!",116,5.0
2435,Sokka, A wanted poster. This is bad.,116,6.0
2436,Katara, I think we better keep moving.,116,6.0
2437,Aang," I have to learn firebending at some point, and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close.",116,21.0
2438,Katara , I guess we could check it out. ,116,7.0
2439,Sokka," What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?",116,21.0
2440,Katara," We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.",116,11.0
2441,Sokka ," Yeh, because we always leave before we get into trouble. ",116,10.0
2442,Aang, Ready disguises!  You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.,116,15.0
2443,Sokka , It's like you're a whole different person.,116,7.0

2457,Aang," I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.",116,13.0
2458,Sokka," Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.",116,8.0
2459,Aang, I gotta learn that trick!,116,5.0
2460,Performer, Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience!,116,13.0
2461,Aang, Oh! Oh! Me! Me!,116,4.0
2462,Sokka, What do you think you're doing?,116,6.0
2463,Aang, I want to get a closer look.,116,7.0
2464,Katara, It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.,116,10.0
2465,Performer," How about you, little lady?",116,5.0
2466,Katara, Uh,116,1.0
2467,Performer," Awww, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!",116,9.0
2468,Aang, Awww! That could'a been me.,116,5.0
2469,Performer," Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast!  It's too strong, I can't hold it!  This next trick is called ""Taming the Dragon.""  You will be my captured princess!",116,31.0
2470,Aang, We gotta help her!,116,4.0
2471,Sokka," No, we don't want to make a scene!",116,8.0
2472,Performer," Hey, you tryin' to upstage me, kid?  The rope, it's breaking!",116,11.0
2473,Audience Member, Hey! That kid's the Avatar!,116,5.0
2474,Sokka, I think it's time to go.,116,6.0

2479,Sokka, I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!,116,9.0
2480,Chey , This way!  Okay! Not this way!,116,6.0
2481,Aang, Nice touch setting off the fireworks.  Appa! Down here!,116,9.0
2482,Sokka, You seem to really know your explosives.,116,7.0
2483,Chey , I'm familiar.,116,2.0
2484,Sokka, You're a Fire Nation soldier!,116,5.0
2485,Chey," I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?  Was. My name's Chey.",116,38.0
2486,Sokka," He was very highly ranked, we get it.",116,8.0
2487,Chey," Yeh! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but he's not! He's enlightened.",116,55.0
2488,Aang, You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?  We've gotta go see him! He can train me!,116,22.0
2489,Sokka, We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!,116,8.0
2490,Chey , He's not crazy! He's a genius! And he's the perfect person to train the Avatar! That's why I followed you into the festival. ,116,23.0
2491,Sokka," Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the north pole in the morning.",116,15.0
2492,Aang," Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me.",116,20.0
2493,Katara, It can't hurt just to talk to him.,116,8.0
2494,Sokka, That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me!?,116,16.0
2495,Lin Yi, Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar!  Don't move!,116,11.0
2496,Sokka," Hold on, you know these guys!?",116,6.0
2497,Chey, Oh yeh! Lin Yi's an old buddy! Right Lin Yi?,116,10.0
2498,Lin Yi, Go on. He sees you only.  Shut up! Keep moving.,116,10.0
2499,Chey," Oh that's okay, we can chat later.",116,7.0
2500,Aang, Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away.,116,14.0
2501,Lin Yi, No! You wait there.  Go now!,116,6.0
2502,Chey," Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!",116,11.0
2503,Zhao," So, the Avatar was here and you let slip away?",116,10.0
2504,Officer," Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch!  No fights. Theft was way down.",116,19.0
2505,Zhao, I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?,116,13.0
2506,Officer ," They headed into the forest, up the river I suspect.",116,10.0
2507,Zhao, Ready the river boats. We're going after the Avatar.,116,9.0
2508,Aang, What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?,116,8.0
2509,Chey, He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here. He wants you to leave immediately.,116,18.0
2510,Sokka, Finally! Let's hit the road. ,116,5.0
2511,Aang, Why won't he see me?,116,5.0
2512,Chey, He says you're not ready. Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.,116,13.0
2513,Aang," Wait, how does he know that?",116,6.0
2514,Chey, He saw the way you walked into camp. He can tell.,116,11.0
2515,Aang, I'm going in anyway!,116,4.0
2516,Jeong Jeong, Get out.,116,2.0
2517,Aang," Master, I need to learn firebending.",116,6.0
2518,Jeong Jeong, Only a fool seeks his own destruction.,116,7.0
2519,Aang , I'm the Avatar. It's my destiny to... ,116,7.0
2520,Jeong Jeong," Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control! He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.",116,53.0
2521,Aang," Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.",116,13.0
2522,Jeong Jeong," To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself. But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.",116,28.0
2523,Aang," Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.",116,11.0
2524,Jeong Jeong," Are you deaf! How can I teach you if you refuse to listen? Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth. Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive! It breathes, it grows, without a bender, a rock will not throw itself! But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it! That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak!",116,82.0
2525,Avatar Roku, You think I am weak?,116,5.0
2526,Jeong Jeong, Avatar Roku! No! No!  I did not mean that!,116,9.0
2527,Avatar Roku," I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes. Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar firebending.",116,25.0
2528,Jeong Jeong," Yes, yes, I will teach you.",116,6.0
2529,Aang, Really? That's great!,116,3.0
2530,Jeong Jeong," Widen your stance.  Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate.  Good, good!  Ughhhhh.",116,12.0
2531,Aang, Wait! What do I do now?,116,6.0
2532,Jeong Jeong," Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking?  Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing!",116,22.0
2533,Sokka, Hey!,116,1.0
2534,Aang, But what am I concentrating on?,116,6.0
2535,Jeong Jeong," Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire. Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!",116,21.0
2536,Aang, So when do I get to make some fire?,116,9.0
2537,Jeong Jeong, Concentrate!,116,1.0
2538,Aang, Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?,116,14.0
2539,Jeong Jeong, No fire yet.,116,3.0
2540,Aang, What?,116,1.0
2541,Jeong Jeong, Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control.,116,16.0
2542,Aang, You brought me up here to breathe?,116,7.0
2543,Jeong Jeong, Wider.  Assume your stance.,116,4.0
2544,Aang, You're not even look... ,116,4.0
2545,Jeong Jeong," What are you doing here!? I did not tell you to stop!  Wider! Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth - without talking.  Good. Keep going.",116,29.0
2546,Aang, I've been breathing for hours.,116,5.0
2547,Jeong Jeong, You want to stop breathing?,116,5.0
2548,Aang, I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun.  I want to know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!,116,32.0
2549,Jeong Jeong," Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.  Ughhhh. I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline. He was only concerned with the power of fire - how he could use it to destroy his opponents and wipe out the obstacles in his path., but fire is a horrible burden to bear. Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it.",116,71.0
2550,Aang, I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient.,116,12.0
2551,Jeong Jeong, We're going to work with fire now.,116,7.0
2552,Aang," I mean, let us begin.  Oh yeh!",116,7.0
2553,Jeong Jeong, Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep this flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.,116,24.0
2554,Rebel, Master! There is trouble.,116,4.0
2555,Aang, What's going on?,116,3.0
2556,Jeong Jeong, Concentrate on your leaf.,116,4.0
2557,Aang, This is the worst firebending instruction ever. All he does is leave me alone for hours to concentrate or breathe.,116,20.0
2558,Katara, I'm sure there's a good reason.,116,6.0
2559,Aang, I did it! I made fire!  But I'm ready to do so much more.,116,14.0
2560,Katara," Careful!  Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.",116,10.0
2561,Aang, Now that's firebending!,116,3.0
2562,Katara," Aang, you'll hurt yourself!",116,4.0
2563,Aang, Katara!  I'm so sorry!   Wonder how that juggler did it?,116,10.0
2564,Sokka," Katara, what's wrong!?  What did you do?",116,7.0
2565,Aang," Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so -",116,10.0
2566,Sokka, You burned my sister!  This is all your fault!  I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! You burned my sister!,116,26.0
2567,Jeong Jeong, I know. Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.,116,10.0
2568,Aang," I'm sorry, I didn't...  I'm sorry!",116,6.0
2569,Jeong Jeong, You have healing abilities.  The great benders of the water tribe sometimes have this ability.  I've always wished I were blessed like you - free from this burning curse.,116,29.0
2570,Katara, But you're a great master. You have powers I'll never know.,116,11.0
2571,Jeong Jeong," Go get your friends and flee!  Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!  Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.",116,53.0
2572,Zhao," Master Jeong Jeong.  Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago.",116,16.0
2573,Sokka, Katara! Are you all right?,116,5.0
2574,Katara," I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?",116,11.0
2575,Aang, Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.,116,19.0
2576,Katara, You'll have to eventually.,116,4.0
2577,Aang," No, never again.",116,3.0
2578,Katara," It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.",116,5.0
2579,Aang, What? How?,116,2.0
2580,Katara," By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.  I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!",116,25.0
2581,Aang, I have to help him!,116,5.0
2582,Zhao, Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.,116,22.0
2583,Jeong Jeong," It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.",116,8.0
2584,Zhao," It's Admiral Zhao, now. ",116,4.0
2585,Jeong Jeong, That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match!,116,19.0
2586,Zhao, I think I can handle a child.,116,7.0
2587,Jeong Jeong, I have never seen such raw power.,116,7.0
2588,Aang, Jeong Jeong!,116,2.0
2589,Zhao, It's a trick! He's run off into the woods. Find him!  Let's find out what my old master has taught you.  We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!,116,27.0
2590,Aang, YOU were Jeong Jeong's student?,116,5.0
2591,Zhao, I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!  Until I got bored.,116,30.0
2592,Aang, Whoa! Wild shot!,116,3.0
2593,Zhao, I'll show you wild!,116,4.0
2594,Aang, No self control...,116,3.0
2595,Zhao," Stand and fight, Avatar!",116,4.0
2596,Aang," Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up.",116,12.0
2597,Zhao, I was!,116,2.0
2598,Aang," Ahoy!  I'm Admiral Zhao!  Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!",116,17.0
2599,Zhao," No wonder to run now, you little smart mouth!",116,9.0
2600,Aang, You've lost this battle.,116,4.0
2601,Zhao, Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!,116,9.0

2608,Aang, Wow! That's good water.,116,4.0
2609,Sokka, When did you learn how to do that?,116,8.0
2610,Katara, I guess I always knew.,116,5.0
2611,Sokka, Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!,116,32.0
2612,Aang, Two?,116,1.0
2613,Katara, He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook.,116,13.0

2615,Storyteller," So travelers, the next time you think you hear a strange large bird talking, take a closer look, it might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man! A member of a secret group of air walkers who laugh at gravity and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!",117,52.0
2616,Aang, Aren't airbender stories the best?,117,5.0

2636,Aang," Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move. They're not airbending. Those people have no spirit. ",117,21.0
2637,Katara," I don't know, Aang. That kid seems pretty spirited!",117,9.0
2638,Sokka, We better find some solid ground before it finds us!,117,10.0
2639,Audience Member, Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!,117,9.0
2640,Teo, Hey there! You're pretty good.,117,5.0
2641,Aang," Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!",117,11.0
2642,Teo, What do you think?  Wow! I don't think I can do that! But here's a good one...,117,17.0
2643,Aang, It's great.,117,2.0
2644,Teo," Hey! You're a REAL airbender! You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.",117,19.0
2645,Aang, Thanks.,117,1.0
2646,Sokka, Wow! This glider chair is incredible!,117,6.0
2647,Teo," If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad designed.",117,16.0
2648,Sokka, Wow!,117,1.0
2649,Teo," Yeh, my Dad is the mastermind behind this whole place! Everything's powered by hot air. It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift when we're gliding.",117,30.0
2650,Aang, This place is unbelievable.,117,4.0
2651,Teo," Yeh, it's great isn't it?",117,5.0
2652,Aang," No, just unbelievable.",117,3.0
2653,Katara, Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.,117,18.0
2654,Sokka, So better!,117,2.0
2655,Aang, Ugh!  This is supposed to be the history of my people.,117,11.0
2656,Katara, I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.,117,11.0
2657,Aang, It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined.,117,13.0
2658,Voice, Look out!,117,2.0
2659,The Mechanist, What the doodle! Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse!,117,21.0
2660,Aang, Do you know what you did? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!,117,15.0
2661,The Mechanist," Well, people around here are starting to stink.",117,8.0
2662,Aang, This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way. I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like.  This whole place stinks!,117,31.0
2663,The Mechanist, The monks? But you're 12!,117,5.0
2664,Teo," Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.",117,13.0
2665,Aang, What are you doing? Who said you could be here?,117,10.0
2666,The Mechanist," Hmmm... doing here... A long time ago, but not a hundred years, my people became refugees after a terrible flood . My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother.  I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere pictures of flying people. But empty! Nobody home! Then I came across these fan like contraptions! ",117,63.0
2667,Aang, Our gliders.,117,2.0
2668,The Mechanist," Yes, little light flying machines. They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone would be on equal ground, so to speak! We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here and after all, isn't that what nature does?",117,49.0
2669,Aang, Nature knows where to stop.,117,5.0
2670,The Mechanist," Come the pulley system must be oiled before dark.   I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us. Look at the time!",117,27.0
2671,Sokka," Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.",117,16.0
2672,The Mechanist, The candle will tell us. Watch.,117,6.0
2673,Sokka, You put spark powder in the candle!,117,7.0
2674,The Mechanist," If you like that, wait till you see my finger safe knife sharpener!  Only took me three tries to get it right!  Four flashes, so it's exactly four hours past midday, or, as I call it, four o'candle! ",117,38.0
2675,Sokka, Aaahhh!,117,1.0
2676,The Mechanist, Follow me!,117,2.0
2677,Teo," Hey Aang, I want to show you something.",117,8.0
2678,Aang, I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.,117,14.0
2679,Teo," I don't know about that. The Temple might be different, but the creatures that live here are probably direct descendents of the ones that lived here a long time ago.",117,30.0
2680,Katara, You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temples origins.,117,10.0
2681,Teo," Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all.",117,12.0
2682,Katara, Hey! It's just like the one in the other Air Temple.,117,11.0
2683,Teo," Only an airbender can open it – so inside it's completely untouched, just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it was like in there.",117,28.0
2684,Katara, Aang?,117,1.0
2685,Aang," I'm sorry, this is the last part of temple that the same as it was. I want it to stay that way.",117,22.0
2686,Teo, I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.,117,12.0
2687,Aang, Thanks.,117,1.0
2688,Sokka, Why would you want to use fireflies for light?  These lanterns are terrible! I can't see.,117,16.0
2689,The Mechanist, Cover your nose and hold your breath.  Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose. Fireflies are a non-flammable light source.,117,20.0
2690,Sokka," Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.",117,15.0
2691,The Mechanist," It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew myself and the whole place even more sky high.  Thought my eyebrows would never grow back! Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time we have gas leaks and they're nearly impossible to find.  Wrong.",117,65.0
2692,Sokka, So this place is an explosion waiting to happen?,117,9.0
2693,The Mechanist," Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell or touch.",117,16.0
2694,Teo," The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you – something even lighter than air, and that something takes over when you fly.",117,24.0
2695,Katara, I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.,117,12.0
2696,Teo, Impossible! Everybody has it.,117,4.0
2697,Aang, Spirit.,117,1.0
2698,Teo, What?,117,1.0
2699,Aang, That's the something you're talking about.,117,6.0
2700,Teo," Are you ready?  Yeh, I suppose it is.",117,8.0
2701,Katara, I can't believe I'm flying!  No!,117,6.0
2702,Aang, Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!,117,14.0
2703,Katara, Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.,117,18.0
2704,Aang," I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.  Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.",117,34.0
2705,Teo, Great!,117,1.0
2706,Katara, Wait! How do I land this thing? What if I land  – eh! Blech! Yech! Bug! Bug! That was a bug!,117,21.0
2707,The Mechanist," I said don't touch anything!  Oh, don't worry, that experiments old and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.",117,21.0
2708,Sokka, Ugh! Week old egg smell!,117,5.0
2709,The Mechanist, Quick! Find that egg!,117,4.0
2710,Teo, I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside. ,117,10.0
2711,Sokka, How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!,117,16.0
2712,The Mechanist, That's the solution to our problem!,117,6.0
2713,Sokka, If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up...  Yeh!,117,18.0
2714,The Mechanist, The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs...,117,10.0
2715,Sokka," Then, if there's a leak...",117,5.0
2716,The Mechanist, You smell rotten eggs! Then you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from...,117,19.0
2717,Sokka, And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!,117,10.0
2718,Both, You're a genius!,117,3.0
2719,The Mechanist, Something's wrong I've got to go.,117,6.0
2720,Aang, This is a nightmare.,117,4.0
2721,The Mechanist , You don't understand.,117,3.0
2722,Aang , You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!,117,7.0
2723,Sokka , You make weapons for the Fire Nation!?,117,7.0
2724,Teo, Explain all this! Now!,117,4.0
2725,The Mechanist," It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this tale. They were going to destroy everything, burn it to the ground. I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us. They asked what I had to offer. I offered... my services. You must understand, I did this for you!",117,63.0
2726,Aang, When are they coming?,117,4.0
2727,The Mechanist, Soon.  Very soon.,117,3.0
2728,Aang, You can't give them more weapons.,117,6.0
2729,The Mechanist, If I don't give them what they want they will destroy this place.,117,13.0
2730,Teo, How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?,117,15.0
2731,The Mechanist, I need some time to think.  You need to leave! Go!,117,11.0
2732,Teo, We're not leaving!,117,3.0
2733,The Mechanist," Then hide, quickly!",117,3.0
2734,Emissary, You know better than to keep me waiting.  Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way.  Well?  Is there a problem?,117,26.0
2735,The Mechanist," No, right this way.",117,4.0
2736,Aang, The deal's off!,117,3.0
2737,Emissary, The Avatar!,117,2.0
2738,The Mechanist," Aang, don't get involved!",117,4.0
2739,Emissary, If I don't get what I came for the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!,117,17.0
2740,Aang, Get out of here! You're leaving empty handed!,117,8.0
2741,Emissary, Then the destruction of this temple will be on your head.,117,11.0
2742,Sokka, This is bad! Very bad!,117,5.0
2743,Katara," Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away?",117,14.0
2744,Aang, I'll tell ya how.  We have something they don't.  Air power! We control the sky. That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!,117,25.0
2745,The Mechanist, I want to help.,117,4.0
2746,Aang ," Good, we'll need it.",117,4.0
2747,The Mechanist ," We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka.",117,10.0
2748,The Mechanist, This boy's a genius!,117,4.0
2749,Sokka, Thank you. You're a genius!,117,5.0
2750,The Mechanist, Thank you!,117,2.0
2751,Sokka," See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne, but once you did, it just kept going.  You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?",117,51.0
2752,Katara," Ugh, if only we knew.",117,5.0
2753,Sokka," A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon. ",117,17.0
2754,Katara, Hmm. That's actually pretty smart.,117,5.0
2755,Sokka," Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...",117,11.0
2756,The Mechanist, ...stink. Never underestimate the power of stink!,117,7.0
2757,Little Girl, They're coming!,117,2.0
2758,Teo, Are we ready?,117,3.0
2759,Katara," Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?",117,8.0
2760,Aang, We'll have to start without him.,117,6.0
2761,Officer," Take them out of the sky, now!",117,7.0
2762,Aang, We've got'em on the run! We need more slime!,117,9.0
2763,Katara, Those things are unstoppable!,117,4.0
2764,Teo," I think I know how they work. I remember my Dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?",117,24.0
2765,Katara, Water? Can you get me close to one?,117,8.0
2766,Teo, We're out of bombs!  No problem!,117,6.0
2767,Katara," Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?",117,7.0
2768,Sokka," Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?",117,7.0
2769,The Mechanist, The insignia! They think we're on their side!,117,8.0
2770,Sokka, Then I guess they won't see this coming.,117,8.0
2771,The Mechanist, Bomb away!,117,2.0
2772,Sokka, Oh no! That was the last one!,117,7.0
2773,The Mechanist," Wait a second,  you smell that?",117,6.0
2774,Sokka, There! That's where the gas is escaping!  Rotten eggs!,117,9.0
2775,The Mechanist, What are you doing!? That's our fuel source!,117,8.0
2776,Sokka, It's the only bomb we've got!,117,6.0
2777,Aang, Look! They're retreating!,117,3.0
2778,All, Yeh!!!,117,1.0
2779,Sokka, We're going down!,117,3.0
2780,Katara, No! Sokka! Hold on!,117,4.0
2781,Sokka, Get ready!,117,2.0
2782,Aang," You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now. It's like the hermit crab , maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other.",117,40.0
2783,Teo, That means a lot coming from you.,117,7.0
2784,Sokka," Aang, you were right about air power.  As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!",117,22.0
2785,Commander, This defeat is the gateway to many victories.,117,8.0
2786,Sokka," I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?",118,11.0
2787,Aang," I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?",118,21.0
2788,Sokka," I'd love to! Climb on everyone , Sokka's ready for takeoff!",118,11.0
2789,Katara," Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.",118,17.0
2790,Sokka, And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. There's nothing up here.,118,15.0
2791,Katara, They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!,118,7.0
2792,Zhao, He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.,118,18.0
2793,Captain Li, Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!,118,10.0
2794,Zhao," Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll need a massive invasion force.",118,49.0
2795,Aang, There it is!,118,3.0
2796,Katara, The Northern Water Tribe...,118,4.0
2797,Sokka, We're finally here...,118,3.0
2798,Katara, I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!,118,9.0

2807,Princess Yue, Very nice to meet you.,118,5.0
2808,Sokka," So... uh... you're a Princess!  You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!",118,17.0
2809,Katara, Ha! Prince of what?,118,4.0
2810,Sokka ," A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here!",118,15.0
2811,Katara ," My apologies, Prince Sokka.",118,4.0
2812,Sokka , So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile. I'm thinking maybe we could... do an activity together?,118,20.0

2823,Zhao," Uncle, is that true?  I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.",118,15.0
2824,Iroh, I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone.  Even the cook!,118,9.0

2826,Zuko, I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.,118,6.0
2827,Zhao," Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?",118,9.0
2828,Iroh, Just rumors. I don't think he is real.,118,8.0
2829,Zhao," He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.  But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.  General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.",118,41.0
2830,Katara, I've waited for this day my whole life! I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!,118,18.0

2833,Aang," Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?",118,12.0
2834,Master Pakku," I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.<u",118,28.0
2835,Katara, What do you mean you won't teach me?  I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me “no”!,118,21.0
2836,Master Pakku, No.,118,1.0
2837,Katara, But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!,118,10.0
2838,Master Pakku, Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite your bad attitude.,118,28.0
2839,Katara," I don't want to heal, I want to fight!",118,9.0
2840,Master Pakku," I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.",118,10.0

2843,Master Pakku, Then what?,118,2.0
2844,Aang, Then I won't learn from you!,118,6.0
2845,Master Pakku, Well have fun teaching yourself. I'm sure you'll do a great job.,118,12.0
2846,Katara, You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.  Wait!  Aang didn't mean that.,118,26.0
2847,Master Pakku, Why don't we get started then.,118,6.0

3586,King Bumi, I'm going to do...  nothing!,203,5.0
3587,Resistance Leader, It doesn't matter now. Fighting the Fire Nation is the only path to freedom. And freedom is worth dying for.,203,20.0
3588,Aang," Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation.  But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.",203,39.0
3589,Resistance Leader," You don't understand. They've taken our home, and  we have to fight them at ANY cost!",203,16.0

3676,Aang,  There are  jins?,203,3.0
3677,King Bumi," Well, technically there are eighty five. But, let's just focus on the third. Neutral jin is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.",203,31.0
3678,Aang,"  That's why you surrendered, isn't it?",203,6.0
3679,King Bumi," Yes, and it's why I can't leave now.",203,8.0
3680,Aang, I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.,203,12.0

3723,Sokka,"  Aang, these are just plants! Do you want me to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" as I swing my machete back and forth?",204,23.0

4058,Katara, Let me handle this.  You're not telling us everything!,206,9.0
4059,Student 2,"  No no, I swear it's true! No one knows where she goes, or who she really is.",206,17.0
4060,Aang,"  That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl in a white dress with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that?",206,28.0
4061,Student 1," Well, a flying boar is the symbol of the Bei Fong family. They're the richest people in town, probably the whole world.",206,22.0

4074,Toph, How did you find me?,206,5.0
4075,Aang,"  Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp and...",206,28.0

4105,Aang, That's amazing.,206,2.0
4106,Toph,  My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless.,206,12.0
4107,Aang, Is that why you became The Blind Bandit?,206,8.0
4108,Toph, Yeah.,206,1.0

4135,Toph," Dad, I know it's hard for you to see me this way, but the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender. And I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect me. But I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me.",206,100.0
4136,Lao," Of course it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Toph. It's made me realize something.",206,17.0

4144,Katara, Don't worry. We'll find you a teacher.  There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there.,206,15.0
4145,Aang, Toph! What are you doing here?   Not like her.,206,9.0
4146,Toph, My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world.,206,14.0
4147,Sokka,"  Well, we'd better get out of here - before your dad changes his mind again.",206,15.0
4148,Toph, Good idea.,206,2.0

4183,Lee,"  Yes.  So, how did you get that scar?",207,8.0
4184,Gansu, It's not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about. A man's past is his business.,207,21.0

4193,Zuko, I don't care. I don't want to play with you.,207,10.0
4194,Azula," We are brother and sister.  It's important for us to spend time together. Don't you think so, mom?",207,18.0
4195,Ursa," Yes darling, I think it's a good idea to play with your sister. Go on now,  just for a little while.",207,21.0

4198,Mai, You two are such... ugh!,207,5.0

4207,Zuko, How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted dad to die?,207,13.0
4208,Azula, I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than  his royal tea loving kookiness.,207,18.0
4209,Zuko," Keep in mind, these are dual swords.  Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of them as separate, because they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole.   You're holding them all wrong.",207,36.0
4210,Lee, I think you'd really like my brother Sen Su. He used to show me stuff like this all the time.,207,20.0

4232,Zuko, What are you talking about? Uncle's not a quitter.,207,9.0
4233,Azula," Oh yes, he is. He found out his son died and he just fell apart.  A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying.",207,36.0

4266,Gow,  Who do you think you are? Telling us what to do?,207,11.0
4267,Zuko," It doesn't matter who I am, but I know who you are. You're not soldiers.  You're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army. You're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war.",207,48.0
4268,Gow,  Are you going to let this stranger stand there and insult you like this?,207,14.0
4269,Old Man, Give him a left! A left!,207,6.0
4270,Old Woman, It's not a fist fight.,207,5.0

4277,Zuko,  My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.  Prince of the Fire Nation and heir to the throne.,207,21.0

4287,Fire Sage," We lay you to rest.    Azulon, Fire Lord to our nation for 23 years. You were our fearless  leader in the battle of Gar Sai. Our matchless conqueror of the Hu Sin provinces.

4288,Toph," Hey, you guys picked a great campsite.  The grass is so soft.",208,12.0
4289,Sokka, That's not grass. Appa's shedding.,208,5.0
4290,Katara,"  Oh, gross!",208,2.0
4291,Aang," You know, rebirth, flowers blooming, and Appa gets a new coat!  That's not gross; it's just a part of spring. ",208,20.0
4292,Katara," Ah, the beauty of spring.  Stop, Appa, stop! ",208,8.0
4293,Sokka," It's not that bad, Katara.  It makes a great wig!",208,10.0
4294,Aang,  And a great beard!,208,4.0
4295,Katara,  I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group because you two are disgusting.,208,16.0
4296,Toph," Excuse me, does anyone have a razor...  ...because I've got some hairy pits!",208,13.0

4298,Toph," Hey, don't worry about me, I'm good to go.",208,9.0
4299,Katara,"  Well, actually, what I'm trying to say is, uh, some of us might fetch water while someone else might set up the fire pit or put up the tent.  Even Momo does his fair share.",208,35.0
4300,Toph,"  Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food, and look,  my tent's all set up.",208,27.0
4301,Katara,"  Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish...",208,11.0
4302,Toph,  don't understand. What's the problem here?,208,6.0
4303,Katara, Never mind.,208,2.0
4304,Sokka, Aaaah!,208,1.0
4305,Aang,  Sorry!,208,1.0

4307,Toph," Yeah, you do seem pretty tired.",208,6.0
4308,Katara,  I meant all of us.,208,5.0

4311,Toph, There's something coming toward us!,208,5.0
4312,Aang, What is it?,208,3.0
4313,Toph, It feels like an avalanche...  But also not like an avalanche.,208,11.0
4314,Sokka, Your powers of perception are frightening.,208,6.0
4315,Katara, Should we leave?,208,3.0
4316,Aang, Better safe than sorry.,208,4.0
4317,Katara, What is that thing?,208,4.0
4318,Toph," Ahh, land, sweet land!  See you guys in the morning!",208,10.0
4319,Katara," Actually, can you help us unload?",208,6.0
4320,Toph,  Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?,208,11.0
4321,Katara," Well, yeah.  That and everything else. You're a part of our team now and...",208,14.0
4322,Toph,  Look.  I didn't ask  to help unload  stuff. I'm carrying my own weight. ,208,13.0
4323,Katara, Ever since joining us you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful.   That's not the point.  ,208,15.0

4325,Katara, How can you be so infuriating!     D-Did you just slam the door in my face!  ,208,15.0
4326,Aang,  Should we... do something?,208,4.0

4333,Toph, That thing is back!,208,4.0

4335,Aang,"  I don't think so, Sokka.",208,5.0
4336,Katara," Seriously, what is that thing?",208,5.0
4337,Toph, And how does it keep finding us?,208,7.0
4338,Aang," I don't know, but this time I'm going to make sure we lose 'em.",208,14.0
4339,Sokka," Okay, forget about setting up camp. I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.",208,17.0
4340,Katara,"  That's good, because Toph wasn't going to help anyway.",208,9.0
4341,Toph,"  Oh, I didn't realize baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed.",208,13.0
4342,Aang,"  Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what  or who it is.",208,17.0
4343,Katara, It could be Zuko. We haven't seen him since the North Pole.,208,12.0
4344,Toph, Who's Zuko?,208,2.0
4345,Sokka,"  Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world. ",208,15.0
4346,Katara,"  What's wrong with ponytails, ponytail?",208,5.0
4347,Sokka, This is a warrior's wolf tail.,208,6.0
4348,Katara," Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky!",208,12.0
4349,Sokka," Aww, don't tell me...  Anyway, whoever's chasing us, they couldn't have followed us here. So... now would everyone just  shhh!  No, Momo, ssh! Sleepy time.  ",208,25.0
4350,Aang, That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.,208,10.0
4351,Toph, I can feel it with my own two feet!,208,9.0
4352,Katara, Let's get out of here!,208,5.0
4353,Aang," Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly.",208,15.0
4354,Sokka, Always the optimist.,208,3.0
4355,Katara, It's those three girls from Omashu!,208,6.0
4356,Toph, We can take 'em. Three on three.,208,7.0
4357,Sokka," Actually, Toph, there's four of us.",208,6.0
4358,Toph," Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all.",208,13.0
4359,Sokka,  I can still fight!,208,4.0
4360,Toph, Okay. Three on three plus Sokka.,208,6.0
4361,Sokka," Well, we wanted to find out who they were. We found out.  Now let's get out of here.",208,18.0
4362,Aang," Appa, yip yip!",208,3.0
4363,Katara, I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.,208,12.0
4364,Toph, I still think we could've taken them.,208,7.0
4365,Katara," Are you kidding? The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them  one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary.",208,33.0
4366,Sokka," Oh no, the sun is rising!  We've been up all night with no sleep.",208,14.0
4367,Aang," Sokka, we'll be okay.",208,4.0
4368,Sokka,  Are you sure!? I've never not slept before! What if I fall asleep now and something happens? And something  happens!,208,20.0
4369,Katara,"  Every time we land, those girls are there, so we'll just have to keep flying.",208,15.0
4370,Aang,"  So, what's the plan?   We can't keep flying forever.",208,9.0
4371,Toph, Don't know... too tired to think.,208,6.0
4372,Katara, I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap.,208,11.0
4373,Sokka, Yes! Sleep!,208,2.0
4374,Toph, What's going on! ,208,3.0
4375,Aang," Wake up, buddy!  Appa fell asleep!",208,6.0
4376,Sokka," Okay, we've put a lot of distance between us and them. The plan now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.",208,23.0
4377,Katara," Of course, we could have gotten some sleep earlier  if Toph didn't have such issues.",208,15.0
4378,Toph,  What!?,208,1.0
4379,Aang," Alright, alright! Everyone's exhausted. Let's just get some rest.",208,9.0
4380,Toph, No! I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have ?,208,15.0
4381,Katara,"  I'm just saying, maybe if you helped out earlier we could've set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!",208,29.0
4382,Toph, You're blaming  for this!?,208,4.0
4383,Aang," No, no! She's not blaming you!",208,6.0
4384,Katara," No, I'm blaming her!",208,4.0
4385,Toph, I never asked you for diddly doo da. I carry my own weight!   Hey! ,208,14.0
4386,Aang, What? You're blaming Appa?!,208,4.0
4387,Toph, He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!  Yeah! You wanna know how they keep finding us?,208,16.0
4388,Aang," How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame, it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not! He is! Appa's carrying your weight!  He never had a problem flying when  it was just the three of us!",208,52.0
4389,Toph, I'm outta here.,208,3.0
4390,Sokka, Wait.,208,1.0
4391,Aang, I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone.  What did I just do!?,208,17.0
4392,Katara," I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other, and I was so mean to her.",208,19.0
4393,Sokka,"  Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.",208,7.0
4394,Katara,"  Thanks, Sokka.",208,2.0
4395,Sokka, No problem.,208,2.0
4396,Katara, We need to find Toph and apologize.,208,7.0
4397,Sokka," Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?",208,17.0
4398,Aang," Toph was right. Appa's fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail!  I have a plan.",208,24.0
4399,Katara, Are you sure that he's okay to fly?,208,8.0
4400,Aang,  He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.  I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail and lead the tank off course.,208,32.0
4401,Iroh, Ohhh... That really hurt my tailbone.,208,6.0
4402,Mai, Wads of wet fur.  How delightful.,208,6.0
4403,Ty Lee," Hmm... They're not wads, more like... bundles.  Or bunches... It's got an ""uh"" sound. ",208,14.0
4404,Mai, Clumps?,208,1.0
4405,Ty Lee,  Clumps!  They're clumps!,208,3.0
4406,Mai, The trail goes this way.,208,5.0
4407,Azula, The Avatar is trying to give us the slip.  You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.  I'll follow this trail.,208,27.0
4408,Sokka," Toph couldn't have made it too far.  What is it, Momo... oh no! Katara!",208,14.0
4409,Katara, How did they find us?,208,5.0
4410,Sokka," Appa, come on! We need to go faster!",208,8.0
4411,Katara, He's too tired!,208,3.0
4412,Sokka," We just need to make it across that river!  Not good, not good! ",208,13.0
4413,Katara," Come on, Appa, just a little further!",208,7.0
4414,Sokka,  We made it! We're safe!,208,5.0
4415,Katara,"  You did it, Appa! ",208,4.0
4416,Sokka," How ya doing?  Good try, but no.",208,7.0
4417,Katara,"  Well, you know!",208,3.0
4418,Mai," I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys  it would be more exciting. Oh well, victory is boring.",208,21.0
4419,Sokka, Thanks Appa. I don't know what we'd do without you.,208,10.0
4420,Ty Lee,"  Was it just me, or was that guy kinda cute?",208,10.0
4421,Aang," Alright, you've caught up with me. Now who are you and what do you want?",208,15.0
4422,Azula, You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint.  I must find the Avatar to restore my honor.  It's okay. You can laugh. It's funny.,208,30.0
4423,Aang, So what now?,208,3.0
4424,Azula," Now... Now it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go. You can run, but I'll catch you.",208,20.0
4425,Aang,  I'm not running.,208,3.0
4426,Iroh, Here is your tea. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.,208,14.0
4427,Toph,  You seem a little too old.,208,6.0
4428,Iroh,  Perhaps I am.,208,3.0
4429,Toph, I know what you're thinking. I look like I can't handle being by myself.,208,14.0
4430,Iroh, I wasn't thinking that.,208,4.0
4431,Toph, You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea. ,208,11.0
4432,Iroh, I poured your tea because I wanted to  and for no other reason.,208,13.0
4433,Toph, People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me. But I can take care of myself by myself.,208,23.0
4434,Iroh, You sound like my nephew.  Always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting people who love you help you.  Not that I love you; I just met you.,208,39.0
4435,Toph,"  So, where is your nephew?",208,5.0
4436,Iroh," I've been tracking him, actually.",208,5.0
4437,Toph, Is he lost?,208,3.0
4438,Iroh,"  Yes, a little bit. His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He is trying to figure out who he is and he went away.",208,29.0
4439,Toph, So... now you're following him.,208,5.0
4440,Iroh," I know he doesn't want me around right now, but, if he needs me, I'll be there.",208,17.0
4441,Toph," Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.  Thank you.",208,13.0
4442,Iroh, My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.,208,14.0
4443,Toph," No, thank you for what you said. It helped me.",208,10.0
4444,Iroh, I'm glad.,208,2.0
4445,Toph," Oh, and about your nephew? Maybe you should tell him that you need  too.",208,14.0
4446,Azula, Do you really want to fight me?,208,7.0
4447,Zuko," Yes,  I really do.",208,4.0
4448,Aang, Zuko!,208,1.0
4449,Azula," I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu.",208,8.0
4450,Aang,   ,208,0.0
4451,Zuko," Back off, Azula! He's mine!",208,5.0
4452,Azula, I'm not going anywhere.,208,4.0
4453,Aang, Katara!,208,1.0
4454,Zuko, Uncle...,208,1.0
4455,Iroh, Get up!,208,2.0
4456,Toph, I thought you guys could use a little help.,208,9.0
4457,Katara,  Thanks.,208,1.0
4458,Azula," Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors all working together. I'm done.  I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor.",208,25.0
4459,Zuko, Get away from us!,208,4.0
4460,Katara," Zuko, I can help!",208,4.0
4461,Zuko, Leave!,208,1.0
4462,Aang," Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?  Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place... i-it's perfect! Don't you think, Sokka?",209,33.0
4463,Toph," Good morning, earthbending student!",209,4.0
4464,Aang," Good morning, sifu Toph.",209,4.0
4465,Katara,  Hey... you never call me sifu Katara.,209,7.0
4466,Aang," Well, if you think I should...",209,6.0
4467,Toph," Sorry, snoozles. We'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can.",209,11.0
4468,Aang, So what move are you going to teach me first? Rockalanche?  The trembler?  Oh! Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land!,209,25.0
4469,Toph," Let's start with ""move a rock"".",209,6.0
4470,Aang, Sounds good! Sounds good!,209,4.0
4471,Toph," The key to earthbending is your stance.  You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element.  If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself. ",209,33.0
4472,Aang, Like a rock. Got it.,209,5.0
4473,Toph," Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple.  Okay, you ready to give it a try?",209,19.0
4474,Aang, I'm ready.,209,2.0
4475,Sokka, Rock beats airbender!,209,3.0
4476,Lu Ten,"  I got you, dad!",209,4.0
4477,Iroh," My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.",209,9.0
4478,Zuko, You were unconscious. Azula did this to you.   Uncle!,209,9.0
4479,Iroh," Somehow, that's not so surprising.",209,5.0
4480,Zuko, I hope I made it the way you like it.,209,10.0
4481,Iroh," Mmm, good.  That was very, uhh... bracing!",209,7.0
4482,Zuko," So uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say",209,42.0
4483,Iroh," No, she's crazy and she needs to go down.  It's time to resume your training.",209,15.0
4484,Katara, I don't understand what went wrong.  He did it exactly the way you did.,209,14.0
4485,Aang, Maybe there's another way.  What if I came at the boulder from a different angle?,209,15.0
4486,Toph," No, that's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender.  There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickity trick that's going to move that rock.  You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this!",209,45.0
4487,Aang, Whoa!,209,1.0
4488,Katara," I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction. ",209,37.0
4489,Toph," Rocklike!  Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that.  Keep your knees high, twinkletoes!",209,14.0
4490,Sokka," Gotcha!  You are a lucky little meat creature.  You're awfully cute, but unfortunately for you, you're made of meat. Just a bit closer...",209,23.0
4491,Iroh," Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.  It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.",209,43.0
4492,Zuko, I see. That's why we're drinking tea,209,7.0
4493,Iroh," There is energy all around us.  The energy is both yin and yang; positive energy and negative energy.  Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together.  You provide release and guidance, creating lightning.  Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes.",209,64.0
4494,Zuko, I'm ready to try it! ,209,5.0
4495,Iroh,"  Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.",209,19.0
4496,Toph," This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock.  Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you.  If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock.  Like this.",209,54.0
4497,Katara," Sorry, Toph, but are you sure this is really the best way to teach Aang earthbending?",209,16.0
4498,Toph," I'm glad you said something.  Actually, there is a better way.  This way he'll really have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara!",209,29.0
4499,Aang,"  Yeah, thanks Katara!",209,3.0
4500,Katara,  Heh.,209,1.0
4501,Aang, I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.,209,11.0
4502,Toph, There's nothing to say. You blew it. You had a perfect stance and perfect form but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts. ,209,28.0
4503,Aang, I know. I'm sorry.,209,4.0
4504,Toph," Yeah, you are sorry. If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you could at least give it the pleasure of smushing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?! ",209,50.0
4505,Aang,  No. I don't think I do.,209,6.0
4506,Katara," Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on, okay?",209,28.0
4507,Aang, Yeah... that sounds good.,209,4.0
4508,Toph," Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better. ",209,9.0
4509,Zuko," Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning, it keeps exploding in my face! Like everything always does!",209,18.0
4510,Iroh, I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.,209,23.0
4511,Zuko,  What turmoil?,209,2.0
4512,Iroh," Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.",209,18.0
4513,Zuko, But I don't feel any shame at all! I'm as proud as ever!,209,13.0
4514,Iroh," Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.",209,20.0
4515,Zuko, Well... my life has been nothing but humbling lately. ,209,9.0
4516,Iroh," I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself!",209,22.0
4517,Sokka," I admit it. You're cute.  Okay, you've convinced me. If I get out of this alive, it's a comically correct vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is   You probably think I deserve this, don't you?  Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things! Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way.",209,68.0
4518,Katara," You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?",209,10.0
4519,Aang,  I don't want to talk about it.,209,7.0
4520,Katara," You do know that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it...",209,17.0
4521,Aang,"  I know I know I know I know, I get it, alright!  I need to face it head-on, like a rock. But I just can't do it! I don't know why I can't, but I can't.",209,36.0
4522,Katara," Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?",209,13.0
4523,Aang, I guess it's earth.,209,4.0
4524,Katara, Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.  That's why it's so hard for you to get this.  You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out.  I know you will.  Think fast!,209,36.0
4525,Aang," Thanks, Katara.  Katara.",209,3.0
4526,Iroh," Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!  Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.",209,109.0
4527,Zuko, Why are you telling me these things?,209,7.0
4528,Iroh," It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.  Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.",209,37.0
4529,Zuko, All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.,209,10.0
4530,Iroh," It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But, it can make you more powerful too.  You see, the technique I am about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.",209,43.0
4531,Toph," Aang! I found these nuts in your bag.  I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it.",209,30.0
4532,Aang," As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have.",209,15.0
4533,Toph," You know, I'm really glad you feel that way, because I also have this great new nutcracker.",209,17.0
4534,Aang," Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't...  That's an antique, hand crafted by the monks...  It's a delicate instrument!",209,18.0
4535,Toph,  It's not the only delicate instrument around here.,209,8.0
4536,Aang, Ohmmmm...,209,1.0
4537,Katara," Hey Aang, have you seen...",209,5.0
4538,Aang,  Meditating here!,209,2.0
4539,Katara, It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.,209,17.0
4540,Aang, We'll find him faster if we split up.,209,8.0
4541,Sokka," Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?  Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff, if I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? OW!  That's all I got! It's pretty much my whole identity! Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy!  But I'm willing to be Sokka the veggies and straight talk fellow! ...Deal?",209,67.0
4542,Aang, Sokka! Are you okay?,209,4.0
4543,Sokka,"  Stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming! ",209,19.0
4544,Aang,  Hmm... I bet I can airbend you out of here.,209,10.0
4545,Sokka," Seriously, Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?",209,19.0
4546,Aang,  I can't. I can't do it.,209,6.0
4547,Sokka,"  If you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.",209,11.0
4548,Aang, I can't do that either.,209,5.0
4549,Sokka, You can't? Why not?,209,4.0
4550,Aang, It would just be really... uncomfortable.,209,6.0
4551,Sokka," Uncomfortable?  Well, I wouldn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.",209,10.0
4552,Aang," Thanks, Sokka.  This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position.",209,30.0
4553,Sokka, Awkward position... I think I know the feeling.,209,8.0
4554,Aang," If I try, I fail. But if I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.",209,28.0
4555,Sokka," Hmm. How about that.  Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.",209,16.0
4556,Aang," Aww, what a cute name for a little baby sabertooth mooselion cub. ",209,12.0
4557,Sokka, Really? He looks nothing like a sabertooth mooselion.,209,8.0
4558,Aang," It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. Whatcha doin' out here, little guy? Did you lose your mama?",209,23.0
4559,Iroh," Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.",209,30.0
4560,Zuko,  You can teach me to redirect lightning?,209,7.0
4561,Iroh," If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.  You must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to your shoulder and down into your stomach.  The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case, it is more like a vast ocean.  You direct it up again and out the other arm.  The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart  or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion to get a feel for the pathway's flow. Like this.  Now, are you focusing your energy Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?",209,129.0
4562,Zuko, I think so. ,209,3.0
4563,Iroh, Excellent! You've got it!  Come on. You've got to feel the flow.,209,12.0
4564,Zuko, Great! I'm ready to try it with real lightning!,209,9.0
4565,Iroh," What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous.",209,8.0
4566,Zuko,  I thought that was the point,209,6.0
4567,Iroh,"  But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you!  If you are lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all.",209,23.0
4568,Zuko," Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning.",209,11.0
4569,Aang,"  Hey, there... we found your cub!  See? We have no problem with you! We're friendly. ",209,15.0
4570,Sokka," This is really bad!  Please, Aang! You have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!   Aang, this is bad! You gotta get me outta here! ",209,26.0
4571,Aang, Oh no!  Whoo-hoo! Look at me!,209,6.0
4572,Sokka,  Please don't leave me again.,209,5.0
4573,Aang,  I won't.,209,2.0
4574,Sokka, What are you doing here?,209,5.0
4575,Toph, Just enjoying the show.,209,4.0
4576,Aang, What? You were there the whole time? ,209,7.0
4577,Toph, Pretty much.,209,2.0
4578,Aang,  Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could've gotten him out and helped us get away!,209,23.0
4579,Toph, I guess it just didn't occur to me.,209,8.0
4580,Aang,  Enough! I want my staff back!,209,6.0
4581,Toph, Do it now.,209,3.0
4582,Aang,  What?,209,1.0
4583,Toph," Earthbend, twinkletoes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast, and even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got the stuff.",209,25.0
4584,Aang, But...,209,1.0
4585,Toph,  You did it! You're an earthbender.  DO IT!,209,8.0
4586,Aang,  I can't believe it! ,209,4.0
4587,Sokka," Aww, this is really a wonderful, touching moment. So, could you get me out of her so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?",209,26.0
4588,Aang," No problem, Sokka!",209,3.0
4589,Toph," Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him.",209,20.0
4590,Sokka," Yeah, no crushing, please.",209,4.0
4591,Katara, You found him! ,209,3.0
4592,Sokka," The whole time that I was in that hole, not knowing if I would live or die, it makes a man think about what's really important. I realized...",209,28.0
4593,Aang,"  Hey, Katara, look what I can do!",209,7.0
4594,Katara," You did it! I knew you would!  You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?",209,14.0
4595,Toph, Yep. It worked wonders.,209,4.0
4596,Aang, Appa! Appa! I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted! Physically and mentally unmovable! ,209,16.0
4597,Zuko,"  You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it! And now I can give it back!  Come on! Strike me! You've never held back before! ",209,29.0
4598,Sokka,  What's out here? ,210,3.0
4599,Toph,  A lot actually. There's hundreds of little-,210,7.0
4600,Aang,"  Heheheha, yeah!  Shhh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch.",210,16.0
4601,Sokka," This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans.   Orchestra, huh? Well la dee da.",210,26.0
4602,Toph, We did make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations.,210,8.0
4603,Sokka, There's no time for vacations.,210,5.0
4604,Aang,  I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.  I practice hard everyday with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrows off.,210,23.0
4605,Katara, Yeah. What's wrong with having a little fun in our downtime?,210,11.0
4606,Sokka,"  Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the fire nation. Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house?  Knock, knock! Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home?  I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're gonna win this war.",210,55.0
4607,Katara," Alright, we'll finish our vacations, and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.",210,12.0
4608,Aang,"  Your turn, Katara.  Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation? ",210,12.0
4609,Katara,  How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.,210,9.0
4610,Aang," Must have changed ownership since I was here.   Oh yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring, and I usually don't use the word pristine. It's one of nature's wonders.",210,32.0
4611,Professor Zei," One mango, please.",210,3.0
4612,Sokka,  Excuse me!  I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy.,210,19.0

4620,Professor Zei,"  Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal.",210,9.0
4621,Sokka," So professor, you're obviously a well traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated.",210,22.0
4622,Professor Zei, Certainly.,210,1.0
4623,Sokka," What, no Fire Nation?  Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?",210,13.0
4624,Katara,  You've made a lot of trips into the desert.,210,9.0
4625,Professor Zei,"  All in vain, I'm afraid.  I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom,  but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel... Wan Shi Tong's Library.",210,27.0
4626,Toph, You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library? ,210,12.0
4627,Professor Zei," This library is more valuable than gold, little lady.  It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge... is priceless.",210,23.0
4628,Toph,"  Mm, sounds like good times.",210,5.0
4629,Professor Zei," Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great knowledge spirit, Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his foxy knowledge seekers.",210,25.0
4630,Sokka," Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?",210,8.0
4631,Katara,"  I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.",210,10.0
4632,Professor Zei,"  You're both right. Handsome little creatures.  Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to read, so that we might better ourselves.",210,35.0
4633,Sokka," If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map maybe?",210,23.0
4634,Professor Zei," I wouldn't know, but if such a thing exists, it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library.",210,15.0
4635,Sokka," Then it's settled.  Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation  AT THE LIBRARY!",210,19.0
4636,Toph,"  Uh, hey? What about me? When do I get to pick?",210,11.0
4637,Sokka,  You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.,210,13.0
4638,Professor Zei," Of course there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert, and almost died each time. I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross.",210,29.0
4639,Sokka," Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?",210,9.0
4640,Professor Zei,  Sandbenders! Shoo! Away from the bison!   A sky bison? You actually have one? ,210,13.0
4641,Aang," Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.",210,13.0
4642,Toph,"  Aw, does this place even exist?",210,6.0
4643,Professor Zei,  Some say it doesn't.,210,4.0
4644,Toph,  There it is!  Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? ,210,9.0
4645,Katara, It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant ornate building from the air.,210,14.0
4646,Sokka, Down there. What's that?,210,4.0
4647,Katara,  Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. The building in this drawing is enormous.,210,16.0
4648,Sokka, What kind of animal is that?,210,6.0
4649,Professor Zei," Oh, we must be close to the library!  I think that was one of the knowledge seekers.",210,17.0
4650,Sokka,"  It's completely buried.  No, this  the library.  Look!",210,8.0
4651,Professor Zei,  My life's ambition is now full of sand.   The library is buried! ,210,12.0
4652,Toph,"  Actually,  that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact, and it's huge.",210,15.0
4653,Sokka, That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look.,210,19.0
4654,Toph, I say you guys go ahead without me.,210,8.0
4655,Katara, You got something against libraries?,210,5.0

4657,Katara," Oh, right. Sorry.",210,3.0
4658,Toph, Let me know if they have something you can listen to.,210,11.0
4659,Aang,  Don't worry buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph.,210,18.0
4660,Toph, What's up?,210,2.0
4661,Professor Zei," Look at those beautiful buttresses!   Oh, it's breath taking. The spirits spared no expense designing this place.",210,17.0

4667,Sokka, Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?,210,12.0
4668,Owl," Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong, he who knows 10,000 things. And you are obviously humans, which by the way are no longer permitted in my study.",210,27.0
4669,Aang, What do you have against humans?,210,6.0
4670,Wan Shi Tong," So,  who are you trying to destroy?  Hmm, humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans,  like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago, looking to destroy his enemy.",210,37.0
4671,Sokka,"  What? Oh, no, no, no destroying, we're not into that.",210,10.0
4672,Wan Shi Tong,  Then why have you come here?,210,6.0

4674,Wan Shi Tong," If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being, you should at least put some effort into it.",210,19.0

4676,Aang," Ow.  Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit.  You have my word.",210,20.0
4677,Wan Shi Tong," Hmm, very well. I'll let you peruse my vast collection, on one condition.  To prove your worth as scholars, you have to contribute some worthwhile knowledge.",210,26.0
4678,Professor Zei, Please accept this tome as a donation to your library.,210,10.0

4683,Wan Shi Tong, I suppose that counts.,210,4.0

4685,Wan Shi Tong," Enjoy the library.   You're not very bright, are you?",210,9.0
4686,Sokka, Bright enough to fool you.,210,5.0
4687,Toph," Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground, where I can see. Well, I don't  the way you do. I feel the vibration in the ground with my feet,  but this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy.  So, you like flyin'?",210,46.0
4688,Aang," Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.",210,8.0

5178,Sokka," Were putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!",213,14.0
5179,Aang,"  Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give 100% of your energy into any one strike.  Sokka, take a fighting stance.You've gotta be quick and accurate.  Hit a series of points, and break your opponent's stance. And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.

5641,Joo Dee,  Joo Dee.,217,2.0

5655,Dai Li Agent, Should we take care of him? ,217,6.0
5656,Long Feng,  No. It's much too dangerous to confront him directly. Let's see if we can still handle this... quietly.,217,18.0

5658,Zuko, The Avatar's here in Ba Sing Se.  And he's lost his bison. ,217,12.0

5874,Sokka," Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.",218,10.0

5905,Earth King," What are you suggesting, Sokka?",218,5.0
5906,Sokka,  That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun.,218,15.0
5907,Earth King,  I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se. We'd be completely vulnerable.,218,17.0

6049,Aang,  I'm never going to fire bend again. I can't.,219,9.0
6050,Guru Pathik,"Hmm, that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a burping bison.  You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar, and therefore, you are a firebender. ",219,38.0
6051,Aang,"  Urrp! Tastes like onion and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles? ",219,11.0
6052,Mai,  I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone can fight in this.,219,16.0

6066,Guru Pathik," Yes. We are all one people, but we live as if divided. ",219,12.0
6067,Aang, We're all connected.  Everything is connected.,219,6.0
6068,Guru Pathik," If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of Earth, that has been purified and refined.  That's right. Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion.  ",219,46.0
6069,Toph," Whoo! Toph, you rule!    Come on metal.... budge. ",219,8.0
6070,Katara, What do you say Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king?  Table for two please.,219,20.0

6075,Aang,  Let's do this.,219,3.0
6076,Guru Pathik," Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river. Forgotten.   The Thought chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world.",219,45.0
6077,Aang,  What? Why would I let go of Katara? I...I..I love her.,219,11.0
6078,Guru Pathik,"  Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe. ",219,18.0

6098,Hakoda, Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?,219,15.0
6099,Sokka,  This can't be good news.,219,5.0
6100,Azula,  What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way! ,219,28.0
6101,Long Feng,"  But you are not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you?  Princess Azula of the Fire Nation!",219,15.0
6102,Azula,  What do you want?,219,4.0

6116,Toph, Ahhh!,220,1.0
6117,Aang and Sokka, Oooo!,220,1.0
6118,Azula," The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death. The coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King, and each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in  command while we overthrow the government.  If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, I will snuff it out. That is all. ",220,93.0
6119,Ty Lee," Nice speech Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way.",220,15.0

6173,Katara," You're a terrible person, you know that? Always following us, hunting the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son.

6804,Piandao," Sokka, when you first arrived, you were so unsure. You even seemed down on yourself. But I saw something in you right away. I saw a heart as strong as a lion turtle, and twice as big. And as we trained, it wasn't your skills that impressed me.  No, it certainly wasn't your skills.  You showed something beyond that.  Creativity, versatility, intelligence... these are the traits that define a great swordsman. And these are the traits that define you.  You told me you didn't know if you were worthy, but I believe that you are more worthy than any man I have ever trained.  We'll make a sword unlike any other in the world.",304,114.0

6812,Katara, But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe?  ,304,12.0
6813,Piandao," The way of the sword doesn't belong to any one nation. Knowledge of the arts belongs to us all.  Sokka, you must continue your training on your own. If you stay on this path, I know that one day you will become an even greater master than I am.",304,49.0

7127,Sokka," Toph, when I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.  Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later  Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner. And as such, I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't want to see any fighting.  Good wittle messenger Hawky. Who's got pwetty feathers?  You're right, Hawky. This is bad.",307,76.0
7128,Toph," Well, it  like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's  the sheet of paper.",307,18.0
7129,Sokka," It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you ""The Runaway.""",307,11.0
7130,Toph,"  A wanted poster. That's  great. ""The Runaway"". I  my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good?",307,21.0
7131,Sokka," Well, yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. But Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.",307,27.0
7132,Toph, Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. Think of it this way. Now you have plenty of money to help with the invasion plan!,307,25.0
7133,Sokka," Well, that  true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa.",307,12.0
7134,Toph, Here's a little extra so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? Make it an atlas.,307,23.0
7135,Sokka, I do like expensive atlases.,307,5.0
7136,Toph, Of course you do. And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret.,307,17.0
7137,Katara," Sokka, tell me you didn't buy a bird.",307,8.0
7138,Sokka," Not just a bird. A messenger bird! Now we can send messages all over the world, even to Gran-Gran.",307,19.0
7139,Aang," Wow, how does it work?",307,5.0
7140,Sokka," Hm, uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky",307,9.0
7141,Katara," Well, look who decided to join us. Where have you two been? Off scamming again?",307,15.0
7142,Toph," Yes, we were.",307,3.0
7143,Katara, And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?,307,13.0
7144,Toph," No, I don't.",307,3.0
7145,Katara, Really?,307,1.0
7146,Toph," Yes, really.",307,2.0
7147,Katara," Well then, what's this?",307,4.0
7148,Toph,"  I don't ! I mean, seriously, what's  you people I'm !",307,11.0
7149,Katara," It's a wanted poster of you. ""The Runaway"". Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this?",307,19.0
7150,Toph, Where did you get that?!,307,5.0
7151,Katara, It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is...,307,10.0
7152,Toph, You went through my stuff! You had no right.,307,9.0
7153,Katara," Your stuff was messy, and I was just straightening up and I happened to stumble across it.",307,17.0
7154,Toph," That's a lie! You're , Katara.",307,6.0
7155,Katara," Fine! It's a lie. But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up. I knew you were hiding something, and you were.  Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!",307,37.0
7156,Toph," Oh, really, ? Or what are you going to do? Send me to my room?",307,15.0
7157,Katara, I wish I could.,307,4.0
7158,Toph," Well, you . Because you're not my mom, and you're not  mom.",307,12.0
7159,Katara, I never said I was!,307,5.0
7160,Toph," No, but you certainly  like it. You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not. You're just a regular kid like the rest of us, so stop acting like you can tell me what to do. I can do whatever I want!",307,45.0
7161,Katara,"  I don't act that way.  Sokka, do I act motherly?",307,10.0
7162,Sokka, Hey - I'm staying out of this one.,307,8.0
7163,Katara," What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?",307,11.0
7164,Aang,"  Well, I...",307,2.0
7165,Katara, Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!,307,10.0
7166,Aang,"  Yes, ma'am.",307,2.0
7167,Toph, I can't be around you right now!,307,7.0
7168,Katara," Well, I can't be around you!",307,6.0
7169,Sokka," </b>Hey, Aang, you want to test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.  I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along?",307,25.0
7170,Aang, Sure.,307,1.0
7171,Sokka," I'm gonna send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again.",307,22.0
7172,Aang," I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.",307,12.0
7173,Sokka," Eh, it's a gift.  Dear Katara. Sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph.",307,12.0
7174,Katara," I  this is from you, Sokka. Toph . Ugh, you're all driving me crazy!",307,14.0
7175,Aang, I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.,307,8.0
7176,Sokka," Yep, we're idiots. ",307,3.0
7177,Aang," I guess plan B is, we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.",307,15.0
7178,Sokka," I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help.  Come on, we need to talk.",307,28.0
7179,Toph, So let me guess. You brought me out here to tell me your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.,307,24.0
7180,Sokka," Nah, she's pretty much a pain.  She's always got to be right about everything, and she gets all bossy, and involved, and in your business.",307,25.0
7181,Toph," Yeah, I don't know how you can deal with it.",307,10.0
7182,Sokka," Actually, in a way, I rely on it.",307,8.0
7183,Toph, I don't understand.,307,3.0
7184,Sokka," When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara, she had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.",307,44.0
7185,Toph, I guess I never thought about that.,307,7.0
7186,Sokka," I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly, I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like, my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there, and now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.",307,64.0
7187,Toph," The truth is, sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom.  Don't  tell her I said any of this.",307,44.0
7188,Sokka," Hey, my lips are sealed.",307,5.0
7189,Katara," Hi, Toph. Um, I want to...",307,6.0
7190,Toph," Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.",307,24.0
7191,Katara,"  Actually, I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say... I want to pull a scam with you!",307,18.0
7192,Toph, What?  want to pull a scam?,307,6.0
7193,Katara," Not just any scam...the ultimate scam!  What do you say, Toph? Just me and you... one last go. You in?",307,20.0
7194,Toph, You know I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours?,307,10.0
7195,Katara," The plan is simple. This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money.  Ten times more than you've made in all your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way.",307,46.0
7196,Toph, How could you do this to me? You betrayed me.,307,10.0
7197,Katara, You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.,307,9.0
7198,Mayor," You did the right thing by turning in ""The Runaway"".",307,10.0
7199,Katara,  The right thing is its own reward.,307,7.0
7200,Mayor," Well, I'm happy to hear you say that.",307,8.0
7201,Katara,  But... I still want the actual reward.,307,7.0
7202,Mayor, Of course. Right this way.,307,5.0
7203,Toph,"  Hey, what kind of cell is this?",307,7.0
7204,Female Fire Nation Officer,  A wooden one.,307,3.0
7205,Mayor, That's her. That's the girl you were looking for.,307,9.0
7206,Aang, Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long? ,307,12.0
7207,Sokka, I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out.  You two behave. Appa's in charge. ,307,18.0
7208,Toph, Wait. It's a trap!,307,4.0
7209,Katara," Really? No kidding. Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?",307,23.0
7210,Toph," Not for , Katara. We're the bait. He wants .",307,10.0
7211,Katara," I can't believe I was so stupid. See, this is exactly why I'm against these scams. I knew this would happen.",307,21.0
7212,Toph, But...this was  idea. ,307,3.0
7213,Katara, I know. I wanted to show you that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.,307,23.0
7214,Toph," Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with. ",307,14.0
7215,Katara," I know your relationship with your parents is complicated, and I shouldn't have said what I said.",307,17.0
7216,Toph," It's ok. I was really mad when you said that because; well, because maybe it's true. I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.",307,32.0
7217,Sokka, Where do you think they might be? ,307,7.0
7218,Aang," Where do you think  is?   Sokka, watch out!  It's ""Sparky-Sparky Boom Man""!",307,12.0
7219,Sokka," You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.",307,11.0
7220,Katara, What are we gonna do?,307,5.0
7221,Toph, I don't know! I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables!,307,14.0
7222,Katara, What about your meteor bracelet? You could make a saw.,307,10.0
7223,Toph," I left it back at camp. I was worried they would take it.  Um, Katara...are you ok?",307,17.0
7224,Katara, Just fine.,307,2.0
7225,Toph," Well, what are you doing?",307,5.0
7226,Katara, I'm making my own water!,307,5.0
7227,Toph," Katara, you're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!",307,8.0
7228,Sokka, This guy is too good. He shoots fire from his brain!,307,11.0
7229,Aang, We should split up. He can't chase us both.,307,9.0
7230,Katara," Aang, get up!",307,3.0
7231,Toph, Let's get out of here.,307,5.0
7232,Sokka," Hey, I got it. The perfect name for that guy! ""Combustion Man""!",307,12.0
7233,Toph," Good job, Sokka. Now let's get out of here before ""Combustion Man"" catches us!",307,14.0
7234,Sokka," Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy?  Yeah, you're such a lazy little bird.  See? It fits so well. ",307,20.0
7235,Toph," Katara, I need your help.",307,5.0
7236,Katara," What is it, Toph?",307,4.0
7237,Toph, I need you to write some things down for me. I want to send a letter to my parents.,307,19.0
7238,Katara, I'll be happy to help.,307,5.0
7239,Sokka," Hey, where'd Hawky go?",307,4.0
7240,Sokka," Suddenly, they heard something down the hall, in the dark. Oooh... It came into the torchlight. And they knew the blade of Wing - Fun was haunted! Aah-ah... ",308,28.0
7241,Aang," I think I liked ""the man with a sword for a hand"" better.",308,13.0
7242,Toph, Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.,308,6.0
7243,Katara," No, wait, I've got one, and this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.",308,14.0
7244,Sokka," Is this one of those ""a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to"" stories?",308,18.0
7245,Katara," No, it happened to Mom.  One winter, when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom realized she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home, just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice,  ""It's so cold and I can't get warm."" Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue, like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but... when every one came back, Nini was gone.",308,118.0
7246,Sokka, Where'd she go? ,308,3.0
7247,Katara," No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day. But sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.",308,29.0
7248,Toph," Wait. Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain, and they're screaming.",308,15.0
7249,Sokka," Pft, nice try.",308,3.0
7250,Toph," No, I'm serious, I hear something.",308,6.0
7251,Katara, You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories.,308,8.0
7252,Toph, It just stopped.,308,3.0
7253,Aang," All right, now I'm getting scared.",308,6.0
7254,Old Woman," Hello, children.  Sorry to frighten you, my name is Hama. You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night. I have an inn nearby, why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?",308,40.0
7255,Sokka," Yes, please.",308,2.0
7256,Katara, Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.,308,12.0
7257,Hama," Aren't you sweet? You know, you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.",308,20.0
7258,Sokka," What do you mean, disappearing?",308,5.0
7259,Hama,"  When the moon turns full, people walk in, and they don't come out.  Who wants more tea?  Don't worry; you'll all be completely safe here. Why don't I show you to your rooms, and you can get a good night's rest?",308,41.0
7260,Sokka," I know Momo, this place is creepy. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep.",308,18.0
7261,Hama, Wakey-wakey.  Time to go shopping.,308,5.0
7262,Katara, That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages.,308,25.0
7263,Hama, You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly.,308,26.0
7264,Townsman, You won't have any ash bananas till next week?,308,9.0
7265,Merchant," Well, I have to send the boy to Hing-Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip.",308,18.0
7266,Townsman," Oh, right, tomorrow's the full moon.",308,6.0
7267,Merchant," Exactly, I can't lose another delivery boy in the woods.",308,10.0
7268,Sokka," People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff during full moons... this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans.",308,17.0
7269,Aang," I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.",308,25.0
7270,Sokka," And then you can sew up this little mystery, lickety-split, Avatar-style.",308,11.0
7271,Aang, Helping people...that's what I do.,308,5.0
7272,Hama, Why don't you all take those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.,308,27.0
7273,Sokka, This is a mysterious little town you have here ,308,9.0
7274,Hama,  Mysterious town for mysterious children.,308,5.0
7275,Sokka," That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.",308,14.0
7276,Katara, That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kind of reminds me of Gran-Gran.,308,24.0
7277,Sokka," But what did she mean by that comment, ""mysterious children""?",308,10.0
7278,Katara,"  Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids, camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?",308,22.0
7279,Sokka, I'm gonna take a look around.,308,6.0
7280,Katara," Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house.",308,13.0
7281,Sokka, It'll be fine.,308,3.0
7282,Aang,She could be home any minute.,308,6.0
7283,Katara,"  Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble, and this is just plain rude.",308,14.0
7284,Sokka, I'm not finished yet.  Come on...,308,6.0
7285,Aang," Ok, that's pretty creepy.",308,4.0
7286,Katara,"  So... she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. Sokka, you've looked enough. Hama will be back soon.",308,19.0
7287,Sokka," Just an ordinary, puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Then why does she have a locked door up here?",308,16.0
7288,Katara,  Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff.,308,11.0
7289,Sokka, We'll see.  It's empty except for a little chest.,308,9.0
7290,Toph,  Maybe it's treasure.,308,3.0
7291,Katara," Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room.",308,11.0
7292,Sokka, I have to see what's in there.,308,7.0
7293,Aang, We shouldn't be doing this.,308,5.0
7294,Sokka, Maybe there's a key here somewhere.,308,6.0
7295,Toph," Oh, hand it over. ",308,4.0
7296,Sokka," Come on, !",308,3.0
7297,Toph, This isn't as easy it looks.,308,6.0
7298,Aang,"  Guys, I don't know about this.",308,6.0
7299,Katara," This is crazy, I'm leaving.",308,5.0
7300,Sokka," Suit yourself. Do it, Toph.",308,5.0
7301,Hama, I'll tell you what's in the box.,308,7.0
7302,Sokka,  An old comb?,308,3.0
7303,Hama, It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I owned from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.,308,18.0
7304,Katara, You're from the Southern Water Tribe?,308,6.0
7305,Hama, Just like you.,308,3.0
7306,Katara, How did you know?,308,4.0
7307,Hama, I heard you talking around your campfire.,308,7.0
7308,Sokka, But why didn't you tell us?,308,6.0
7309,Hama," I wanted to surprise you. I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big, Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes, if you stew them long enough.",308,47.0
7310,Aang,  Great.,308,1.0
7311,Katara, I knew I felt a bond with you right away.,308,10.0
7312,Sokka," And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.  But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.",308,21.0
7313,Hama, Apology accepted. Now let's get cooking.,308,6.0
7314,Aang," I'd steer clear of the ""sea prunes"".",308,7.0
7315,Toph, I thought they were ocean kumquats.,308,6.0
7316,Aang, Close enough.,308,2.0
7317,Hama, Who wants five-flavor soup?,308,4.0
7318,Katara, You're a Waterbender! I've never met another Waterbender from our tribe.,308,11.0
7319,Hama,  That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one.,308,14.0
7320,Sokka, So how did you end up out here?,308,8.0
7321,Hama,"  They came again and again, each time, rounding up more of our Waterbenders, and taking them captive.   I was stolen from my home.  It was over 60 years ago when the raids started. ",308,33.0
7322,Hama&gt;,"  We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued. ",308,16.0
7323,Hama,"  I was led away in chains. The last Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe.    Finally, I too was captured.",308,19.0
7324,Sokka, How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?,308,14.0
7325,Hama, I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.,308,9.0
7326,Katara, We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.,308,10.0
7327,Hama,"  Oh, you poor things.",308,4.0
7328,Katara," I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor, you're a hero.",308,16.0
7329,Hama," I never thought I'd meet another Southern Waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know, so you can carry on the Southern Tradition when I'm gone.",308,27.0
7330,Katara,"  Yes, yes of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.",308,15.0
7331,Hama,"  Growing up at the South Pole, Waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas.  But, as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go.",308,33.0
7332,Katara," I know, when we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.",308,19.0
7333,Hama, That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.,308,12.0
7334,Katara, I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.,308,8.0
7335,Hama," That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you can even pull water out of thin air?  You've got to keep an open mind, Katara.  There's water in places you never think about.",308,39.0
7336,Aang," This has gotta be the nicest, natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.",308,24.0
7337,Toph, Maybe the moon spirit just turned mean.,308,7.0

7354,Old Man Ding," Didn't see no spirit. Just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain.  I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my  limbs.  It just about had me into a cave up there. And I looked up at the moon, for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light. But then, the sun started to rise. And I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!",308,88.0

7585,Sokka,"  Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg. Now I didn't like Aang at first but I grew to love him over time. Then we went over to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and thenwe met Suki, who is a Kyoshi warrior.  She made me dress like a woman and then she kissed me ",310,59.0

7588,Hakoda," Thank you, Sokka.  It's okay, why don't you take a break?  Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. Today is the Day of Black Sun  and I want to thank you all for your self sacrifice and your courage.  They're two steps to the invasion. A naval stage and then a land stage. To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital,  we have to get pass our first major obstacle here.  The Great Gates of Azulon. Next,  we hit the land and we hit hard  We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower  Once we do that,  it's up to the royal palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin. ",310,116.0
7589,Boulder,"  Excuse me, The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade the eclipse? When the firebenders are ?",310,18.0
7590,Hakoda," The eclipse only last 8 minutes. Not enough time for the whole invasion and the royal palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse advantage the most. When this is finished, the Avatar would have defeated the Fire Lord. We would have control of the Fire Nation capital  and this war will be over! ",310,59.0
7591,Aang, We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave.,310,12.0
7592,Sokka,"  I messed up, Aang. ",310,4.0
7593,Aang, What?,310,1.0
7594,Sokka, The invasion plan was my moment of truth. And I completely flopped it. I just fell apart.,310,17.0
7595,Aang," Sokka,  that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking and nobody's really good at that.",310,19.0
7596,Sokka, My Dad is. He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone. Like a real leader should. ,310,16.0
7597,Aang," Look, your moment of truth isn't going to be in front of some map. It's going to be out there,  on the battlefield. ",310,23.0
7598,Sokka, You seem so confident about everything. How do you know we're going to win?,310,14.0
7599,Aang, Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again. ,310,17.0

7609,The Duke,  Helmet?,310,1.0
7610,Sokka," Well, I just came up with the idea but The Mechanist did all the work. ",310,15.0
7611,The Mechanist," But don't sell yourself short, my boy. It was your idea  to use waterbending to make the subs sink and float. Brilliant, though your original designs were a bit difficult to decipher.  Unfortunately, there is one problem I couldn't fix.  The subs have a limited air supply.  Before we land on the beaches, we'll need to resurface. ",310,57.0
7612,Ming," Lunchtime, General Iroh.  And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice.",310,14.0

7652,Katara, No offense Sokka but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.,310,10.0
7653,Sokka, No.  I'll lead the invasion force. ,310,6.0
7654,Katara," Don't be crazy, Sokka.",310,4.0
7655,Sokka, Maybe I am a little crazy but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano  by the time it does.,310,26.0
7656,Hakoda,"  You can do this. I'm proud of you, son. ",310,9.0
7657,Katara, I still think you're crazy but I'm proud of you too. ,310,11.0
7658,Sokka,"  Listen up everyone,  I want the tanks in wedge formation!  Warriors and benders in the middle.  We're taking that tower  and headed for the royal palace!   Yip yip. ",310,28.0

7663,Sokka, Dad! You're on your feet again.,311,6.0
7664,Hakoda, Thanks to your sister. I'm in no shape to fight but maybe there is someway I could help.,311,18.0
7665,Sokka, Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.,311,11.0
7666,Hakoda," Let's hope our luck holds out. Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?",311,13.0
7667,Katara, Yeah... Is that... is that Aang?,311,6.0
7668,Sokka, Please tell you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down?  What?,311,27.0
7669,Aang, He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.,311,12.0
7670,Sokka, They knew.,311,2.0
7671,Aang, It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long gone. Far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.,311,22.0
7672,Sokka, No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker. Somewhere he could go so it'll be safe during a siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.,311,36.0
7673,Toph," If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it. ",311,16.0
7674,Sokka, The Mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse. 10 minutes to find the Fire Lord. ,311,26.0
7675,Aang, We can still do this. We can still win the day.,311,11.0
7676,Katara," Wait. If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap. Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure all of us get out of here safely. ",311,33.0
7677,Hakoda," Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it.",311,36.0
7678,Sokka," What do you think? You're the one who has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.",311,20.0
7679,Aang, Do you feel anything down there?  I've got to try.,311,10.0
7680,Toph,  Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano. ,311,12.0
7681,Sokka, Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?,311,7.0
7682,Toph,"  There's something big, dense, and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano. ",311,15.0
7683,Sokka, Sounds like a secret bunker to me.,311,7.0
7684,Aang, Stay safe. We'll be back soon.,311,6.0
7685,Toph, This way! That one's a dead end.,311,7.0
7686,Sokka, What would we do without you?,311,6.0
7687,Toph, Perish and burn in hot magma.,311,6.0
7688,Sokka," Yeah, pretty much.",311,3.0
7689,Toph, The tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker.,311,14.0
7690,Sokka, We'll have to be fast but careful. ,311,7.0
7691,Aang, How was that careful?,311,4.0
7692,Sokka," There's no floor! It's just a river of lava.   I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.",311,20.0
7693,Aang, Climb aboard and hold on tight.,311,6.0
7694,Sokka, That's some door!,311,3.0
7695,Toph, Not a problem. ,311,3.0
7696,Sokka, I am so glad we added you to the group.,311,10.0
7697,Fire Nation Fighter #1, Retreat! Everyone move to secondary defensive position! Retreat! ,311,8.0
7698,Bato, The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up the hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished!,311,31.0
7699,Katara, We can wait here if you want.,311,7.0
7700,Hakoda, No. I want to press forward with the others. ,311,9.0
7701,War Minister Qin, The Fire Lord's chamber is that way down the hall to the left and up the stairs. You can't miss it. ,311,21.0
7702,Aang,  Thanks.,311,1.0
7703,Sokka, Only 30 seconds until the total eclipse.,311,7.0
7704,Aang, I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord. ,311,9.0
7705,Azula," I had a hunch that you survived. It doesn't matter, I've known about the invasion for months.  So, you are alive after all. ",311,23.0
7706,Zuko, I'm ready to face you. ,311,5.0
7707,Fire Lord Ozai," Prince Zuko, what are you doing here? ",311,7.0
7708,The Mechanist, The eclipse is starting. Put on your eclipse glasses.,311,9.0
7709,Fire Lord Ozai, Why are you here? ,311,4.0
7710,Zuko, I'm here to tell the truth. ,311,6.0
7711,Fire Lord Ozai, Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. This should be interesting. ,311,13.0
7712,Zuko," First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me. ",311,17.0
7713,Fire Lord Ozai, Why would she lie to me about that? ,311,8.0
7714,Zuko, Because the Avatar is not dead. He survived. ,311,8.0
7715,Fire Lord Ozai,  What?!,311,1.0
7716,Zuko," In fact, he probably is leading this invasion. He could be on us right now. ",311,15.0
7717,Fire Lord Ozai,  Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you. ,311,16.0
7718,Zuko, That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore. ,311,10.0
7719,Fire Lord Ozai,  You will obey me or this defiant breathe will be your last! ,311,12.0
7720,Zuko, Think again! I am going to speak my mind and you are going to listen. ,311,15.0
7721,Aang, Where is he? Where is the Fire Lord? ,311,8.0
7722,Azula,"  Hm, you mean I'm not good enough for you? You're hurting my feelings. ",311,13.0
7723,Sokka,  Stop wasting our time and give us the information. You're powerless right now so you're in no position to refuse. ,311,20.0
7724,Toph, And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying. ,311,13.0
7725,Azula, Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar.  I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.,311,23.0
7726,Toph,"  Okay you're good, I admit it.  But you really ought to consider telling the truth anyway.",311,16.0
7727,Azula," When I left Ba Sing Se, I brought home some souvenirs.  Dai Li agents.",311,14.0
7728,Bato," Surround the periphery! We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over. Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives.",311,26.0
7729,Tyro, Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you.,311,8.0
7730,Fire Nation Fighter #2," We'll never surrender. Er okay, we surrender.",311,7.0
7731,Hakoda, There it is. The Fire Nation royal palace. We've come so far. ,311,12.0
7732,Katara, It's not over yet. ,311,4.0
7733,Zuko," For so long, all I wanted was you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor that I wanted but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.  My father, who challenged me; a 13-year-old boy to an Agni Kai. How can you possibly justify a duel with a child? ",311,66.0
7734,Fire Lord Ozai, It was to teach you respect.,311,6.0
7735,Zuko, It was cruel! And it was wrong. ,311,7.0
7736,Fire Lord Ozai, Then you have learned nothing.,311,5.0
7737,Zuko," No, I've learnt everything! And I had to learn it on my own. Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history and somehow, the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation! They don't see our greatness, they hate us! And we deserve it. We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.",311,105.0
7738,Fire Lord Ozai,"  Your Uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he?",311,8.0
7739,Zuko,  Yes. He has. ,311,3.0
7740,Aang, I can't pin her down. She's too quick.,311,8.0

7742,Azula,"  Not true, I'm giving it my all. ",311,7.0
7743,Toph, You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!,311,11.0
7744,Azula," Um, right. I think your friend just said that genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes. ",311,23.0
7745,Toph, I 'll roll your whole head!,311,6.0
7746,Sokka, She's just baiting you again. ,311,5.0
7747,Aang," Okay, so what do we do? Just ignore her? ",311,9.0
7748,Sokka, We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.,311,22.0
7749,Azula, It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you.,311,9.0
7750,Sokka,  Ignore!,311,1.0
7751,Azula,"  Come and get it...   So, Sokka's your name right My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.  She was convinced that you were going to come rescue her. Of course, you never came and she gave up on you. ",311,41.0
7752,Sokka, Where is Suki?!,311,3.0
7753,Zuko," After I leave here today, I'm going to free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm going to beg for his forgiveness. He is the one who has been a real father to me. ",311,34.0
7754,Fire Lord Ozai,  That's just beautiful. Maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure. ,311,16.0
7755,Zuko, But I've come to an even more important decision. I'm going to join the Avatar. And I'm going to help him defeat you. ,311,23.0
7756,Fire Lord Ozai,"  Really? Since you're a full blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless, you've got yourswords, why don't you just do it now?",311,27.0
7757,Zuko, Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.  Goodbye. ,311,14.0
7758,Fire Lord Ozai,"  Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me but you'll only do it during an eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the Sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your Mother?",311,41.0
7759,Zuko, What happened that night? ,311,4.0
7760,Fire Lord Ozai," My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son. And I was going to do it. Your Mother had found out and swore she would protect you at any cost. She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan. A plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared. ",311,64.0
7761,Sokka,  Where's Suki?! Answer me! ,311,4.0
7762,Aang,"  Sokka, she won't talk. ",311,4.0
7763,Sokka,  Where are you keeping her?!,311,5.0
7764,Fire Lord Ozai," Your Mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished.",311,21.0
7765,Zuko,  So she's alive.,311,3.0
7766,Fire Lord Ozai, Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. Your penalty will be  steeper. ,311,19.0
7767,Azula, Dad's all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to see you now.   Oh. Sounds like the firebending's back on. ,311,36.0
7768,Sokka, I fell for it! I used up all our time. ,311,10.0
7769,Toph," It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out. ",311,16.0
7770,Sokka,  And now it's too late. ,311,5.0
7771,Aang, Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over but I can face the Fire Lord anyway.,311,17.0
7772,Sokka, No. I don't think that's a good idea. ,311,8.0
7773,Aang, But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me. ,311,16.0
7774,Toph, The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go help our friends. ,311,36.0
7775,Aang, I guess you guys are right.,311,6.0
7776,Sokka,  You'll have another chance. I know you will.,311,8.0
7777,Bato,"  What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now? ",311,11.0
7778,Hakoda, I don't know. But now that the eclipse is over I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.,311,20.0
7779,The Mechanist,  My own invention. Oh this is terrible! ,311,7.0
7780,Katara, They're back!,311,2.0
7781,Sokka," It was all a trap. Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move. We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely. ",311,43.0
7782,Aang,"  They've got air power, but so do I!  I'm going to do what I can to slow them down. ",311,19.0

7784,Sokka," Everyone, let's get back to the subs! ",311,7.0
7785,Katara, We can't keep them all back. They're too many of them! ,311,11.0
7786,Aang, Let's join the others.,311,4.0
7787,Zuko, Where is my Uncle?   Uncle! ,311,5.0
7788,Warden Poon,  He's gone. He busted himself out. I... I've never seen anything like it! He was like a one man army!,311,20.0
7789,Sokka, Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs.,311,12.0
7790,Katara, Why aren't they turning around to attack us again? ,311,9.0
7791,Aang, They're headed for the beach. They're going to destroy the submarines!,311,11.0
7792,Sokka, How are we all going to escape?,311,7.0
7793,Hakoda, We're not.,311,2.0
7794,Sokka," Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win! ",311,17.0
7795,Hakoda," Yes, with the Avatar we could still win on another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.",311,23.0
7796,Katara, What? We can't leave you behind. We won't leave anyone behind. ,311,11.0
7797,Hakoda, You're our only chance in a long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe. It's the only way to keep hope alive. ,311,26.0
7798,Bato, The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay behind and surrender. We'll be prisoners but we'll all survive this battle. ,311,25.0
7799,Tyro, I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy but we'll get by. ,311,19.0

7806,Tyro, If we don't escape on our own first. ,311,8.0
7807,Hakoda, We lost today but we've never been this close. We tasted victory and that counts for something. ,311,17.0
7808,Katara, We'll miss you Dad.,311,4.0
7809,Sokka, Bye Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.,311,13.0

7812,Azula," No. They're too fast. It doesn't matter, they'll be back. ",311,10.0
7813,Aang, I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple.,311,20.0
7814,Katara, This is humiliating.,312,3.0
7815,Sokka," Do you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation,  or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?",312,22.0

7826,Iroh,  What a stunning view.,312,4.0
7827,Zuko, The only view I'm interested in seeing  is the Avatar in chains.,312,12.0
7828,Iroh,"  You know,  the Avatar hasn't been seen for a 100 years.  The chances of finding him here are very slim. ",312,20.0
7829,Zuko," First, we'll check each of the air temples.  Then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.",312,23.0
7830,Iroh,"  Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment.  You should take some time to heal and rest.",312,19.0
7831,Zuko,  What else would I expect to hear from the  man in the ?  The only way  to regain my honor is to find the Avatar. So I will.(. . ,312,29.0
7832,Teo, It's so different from the Northern Air Temple.  I wonder if there are any secret rooms.,312,16.0
7833,Haru,  Let's go check it out.,312,5.0
7834,Katara, You guys go...  I think we need to talk about some things.,312,12.0

7839,Aang," Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?",312,7.0
7840,Sokka," Well, if you ask me, the  plan is the  plan. You just need to master all four elements, and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.",312,27.0
7841,Aang,"  Oh, yeah, that's great.  No problem, ( I'll just do that. ",312,11.0
7842,Katara," Aang, no one said it's gonna be easy.",312,8.0
7843,Aang,"  Well, it's not even gonna be possible. Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?",312,16.0
7844,Katara,  We could look for Jeong Jeong.,312,6.0
7845,Aang," Yeah right,  like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.",312,10.0
7846,Toph,"  Who's - Oh,  never mind. If it's important, I'll find out.",312,11.0
7847,Aang," Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we  just take a nice tour  around the temple?",312,20.0
7848,Toph,  What's up with him? ,312,4.0
7849,Sokka, There's got  to be someone who can teach him firebending.,312,10.0
7850,Zuko,"  Well, what's your answer?!  Hello,  Zuko here. But I guess  you probably already know me... sort of. Uh...so, the thing is,  I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm  considered to be pretty good at it.  Well, you've seen me... you know, when I was attacking you?  Uh, yeah...I guess  I should apologize for that. But anyway,  I'm good now.  I mean, I thought I was good before, but now I realize I was bad.  Ugh, but anyway... I think it's time I joined your group, and taught  the Avatar firebending.",312,92.0
7851,Katara," Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?",312,9.0
7852,Aang,  What? The wind is too loud in my ears. Check out this loop.,312,13.0
7853,Sokka,"  Aang,  I think we should be making some plans about our future. ",312,12.0
7854,Aang," Ok, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table.  Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber.",312,22.0
7855,Toph,  I think that'll have to wait.,312,6.0
7856,Zuko," Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so I just thought  I'd wait for you here.   Hello,  Zuko here.",312,21.0
7857,Sokka," Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.",312,10.0
7858,Zuko,"  Right... Well, uh... anyway, what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I uh,  I'm good now. And, well, I think I should join your group. Oh, and I can teach firebending... to you.  See, I uh...",312,41.0
7859,Toph,  You want to what now?! ,312,5.0
7860,Katara," You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?",312,22.0
7861,Sokka," Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt us down  and capture Aang.",312,14.0
7862,Zuko,"  I've done some good things.  I mean, I could've stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.  That's something.",312,23.0
7863,Toph, Appa  does seem to like him. ,312,6.0
7864,Sokka, He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not  buying it.,312,19.0
7865,Zuko," ( I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes  in the past.",312,19.0
7866,Sokka,  Like when you attacked our village?,312,6.0
7867,Katara,  Or when you stole my mother's necklace  and used it to track us down  and capture us?,312,17.0
7868,Zuko,"  Look, I admit I've done some awful things. I was wrong  to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.  And I never should've sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.  I'm gonna try to stop him.",312,42.0
7869,Sokka,"  Wait, you sent  Combustion Man after us?",312,7.0
7870,Zuko,"  Well, that's not his name, but...",312,6.0
7871,Sokka,"  Oh, .  I didn't mean to insult your friend.",312,9.0
7872,Zuko,  Why aren't you saying anything?  You once said you thought we could be  friends.  You know I  have good in me.   He's not my friend!,312,25.0
7873,Aang, There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.  We'll never let you join us. ,312,17.0
7874,Katara,"  You need to get out of here, now.",312,8.0
7875,Zuko,  I'm trying to explain  that I'm not that person anymore. ,312,10.0
7876,Sokka," Either you leave, or we attack.",312,6.0
7877,Zuko,"  If you won't accept me as a friend,  then maybe you'll take me  as a prisoner.",312,16.0
7878,Katara,"  Get out of here  and don't come back. And if we ever see you again...Well,  we'd better not see you again!(. .   No, we won't!",312,25.0
7879,Zuko," Argh, I can't believe how   I am. I mean,  what was I thinking?  Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula  did that? They  would've believed that. Stupid!",312,34.0
7880,Katara, Why would he try to fool us like that? ,312,9.0
7881,Sokka," Obviously, he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.",312,11.0
7882,Katara," This is just like when we were in prison together in Ba Sing Se.  He starts talking about his mother,  and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.",312,32.0
7883,Sokka," He wants you  to trust him and feel sorry for him, so you let your guard down,  he strikes. ",312,19.0
7884,Katara,"  The thing is, it worked.  I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt.  But obviously when the time came, ( he made his choice, and we paid the price.  We can't trust him.",312,40.0
7885,Aang,  I kind of  have a confession to make.  Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by  Zhao?,312,20.0
7886,Sokka,  And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget?  I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!,312,31.0
7887,Katara,"  Sokka,  I looked at it and told you there was nothing there.",312,12.0
7888,Sokka,  I could feel it! It's  throatal flap. ,312,7.0
7889,Aang," Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was   who came in and got me out.  He risked his life to save me. ",312,23.0
7890,Katara," No way,  I'm sure  he only did it  so he could capture you himself.",312,14.0
7891,Sokka," Yeah,  face it Aang. You're nothing but a big prize to him.",312,12.0
7892,Aang, You're probably right.,312,3.0
7893,Katara, And what was  all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free?  What a liar.,312,14.0
7894,Toph,"Actually,  he wasn't lying.",312,4.0
7895,Sokka,"  Oh, hooray. ( In a lifetime of evil, at least  he didn't add animal cruelty to the list. ",312,18.0
7896,Toph,"  I'm just saying that  considering his messed-up family, and how he was raised, he could've turned out a lot worse. ",312,20.0
7897,Katara," You're right,  Toph, let's go find him  and give him a medal.  The ""not as much of a jerk as you could have been"" award.",312,25.0
7898,Toph,"  All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe  you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly. ",312,27.0
7899,Katara," ( Easy for you to say, you weren't there  when he had us attacked by pirates.",312,16.0
7900,Sokka,  Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island.,312,7.0
7901,Aang, Or when he tried to capture me  at the fire temple. ,312,11.0
7902,Katara, Why would you  even  to defend him?,312,7.0
7903,Toph,"  Because Katara,  you're all ignoring  one crucial fact. Aang needs  a firebending teacher. We can't think  of a  person in the world to do the job.  and you  won't even think  about it?",312,33.0
7904,Aang, I'm not having Zuko as my teacher. ,312,7.0
7905,Sokka," You're darn right  you're not, buddy.",312,6.0
7906,Katara," Well,  I guess that's settled.",312,5.0
7907,Toph,  I'm beginning to wonder who's  the blind one  around here.,312,10.0
7908,Zuko, Who's there?  Stay back.,312,4.0
7909,Toph," You burned my feet!   It's me! style=""mso-spacerun",312,7.0

7912,Zuko, Let me  help you.  I'm sorry.,312,6.0
7913,Toph," Get  me,  get off me!",312,5.0
7914,Zuko,  I didn't know it was you.  Come back!  Why am I so bad at being good?,312,16.0
7915,Katara,  Has anyone seen Toph?,312,4.0
7916,Sokka, I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.,312,9.0
7917,Haru, Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.,312,16.0
7918,Katara,  I think we should go look for her.,312,8.0
7919,Sokka," Oh, let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.",312,19.0
7920,The Duke, We can go check for her.,312,6.0
7921,Teo,"  Yeah, I want to ride that tunnel down to the hall of statues again. It'll work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes.",312,25.0
7922,Katara," Toph, what happened?",312,3.0
7923,Toph, My feet got burned.,312,4.0
7924,Katara,"  Oh, no, what happened?",312,4.0
7925,Toph,"  I just told you, my feet got burned.",312,8.0
7926,Katara, I meant how.,312,3.0
7927,Toph," Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night.",312,10.0
7928,Aang,  You what!?,312,2.0
7929,Katara,  Zuko?,312,1.0
7930,Sokka,  Ugh!,312,1.0
7931,Toph," I just thought he could be helpful to us. And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out.",312,21.0
7932,Aang, So he attacked you?,312,4.0
7933,Toph," Well, he did and he didn't. It was sort of an accident.",312,12.0
7934,Aang, But he  firebend at you?,312,5.0
7935,Toph, Yes.,312,1.0
7936,Sokka," See, you trusted Zuko and you got burned... literally.",312,9.0
7937,Katara,  It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. I wish I could've worked on them sooner.,312,19.0
7938,Toph," Yeah, me too.",312,3.0
7939,Sokka, Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.,312,15.0
7940,Aang,"  I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.",312,24.0
7941,Sokka," He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.",312,10.0
7942,Toph,  Maybe just invite him back here. He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.,312,15.0
7943,Sokka, Yeah... get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner. Then we'll jump him and  make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it.,312,25.0
7944,Katara," You are a master of surprise, Sokka.",312,7.0
7945,Toph," Ahh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks.",312,23.0
7946,Zuko, The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop!   Stop!  I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore.,312,18.0
7947,Toph,  He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side.,312,12.0
7948,Katara, I can't step out to waterbend at him without getting blown up. And I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.,312,25.0
7949,Sokka," All right buddy, don't fail me now.   I know how to get an angle on him.",312,16.0
7950,Aang, I can't believe I'm saying this... but thanks Zuko.,312,9.0
7951,Sokka," Hey, and what about me? I did the boomerang thing. ",312,10.0
7952,Zuko," I'm sorry for what I did to you.  It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild. So as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending so I don't hurt people unintentionally.   Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday. I've been through a lot in the past few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want now is to play my part in ending this war. And I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world.",312,146.0
7953,Aang," I think you  supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara. And after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love.  I'd like you to teach me.",312,50.0
7954,Zuko, Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.,312,11.0
7955,Aang," Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's ok with them. Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?",312,26.0
7956,Toph,  Go ahead and let him join. It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.,312,21.0
7957,Aang, Sokka?,312,1.0
7958,Sokka,"  Hey, all I want is to defeat The Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then I'm all for it.",312,25.0
7959,Aang, Katara?,312,1.0
7960,Katara, I'll go along with whatever  think is right.,312,8.0
7961,Zuko,"  I won't let you down, I promise.",312,7.0
7962,Sokka," So here you go, home sweet home. I guess, you know, for now.  Unpack... lunch soon. Uh...welcome aboard? Yeah.  Ok, this is really, really weird.",312,25.0
7963,Zuko," If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar. I know it's my destiny to capture him.",312,26.0
7964,Iroh," You know, Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.",312,39.0
7965,Katara,"  You might have everyone else here buying your "" But you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past.  So let me tell you something right now. You make one step backward, one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang... and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends right then and there... .",312,72.0
7966,Zuko,"  I know you're nervous,  but remember... firebending in and of itself is  something to fear. ",313,15.0
7967,Aang, Ok. Not something to fear. ,313,5.0
7968,Zuko," Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make.   But if you don't respect it,  it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino! ",313,32.0
7969,Aang, Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration? ,313,10.0
7970,Zuko,  What was that?! That was the worst firebending I've ever seen!    Good idea. You might want to take a couple steps back.,313,22.0
7971,Aang,"  I thought it was,  nice. ",313,5.0
7972,Zuko,  Why is this happening?!,313,4.0
7973,Aang, Maybe it's the altitude.,313,4.0
7974,Zuko," Just breathe, and...    Yeah, could be. ",313,6.0
7975,Aang, That one kind of felt hot. ,313,6.0
7976,Zuko,  Don't patronize me. You know what it's supposed to look like! ,313,11.0
7977,Aang, Sorry Sifu Hotman.,313,3.0
7978,Zuko,  And stop calling me that! ,313,5.0
7979,Sokka," Hey, . Mind if I watch you two  do your  bending? ",313,11.0
7980,Zuko, Get out of here! ,313,4.0
7981,Sokka," Ok, take it easy.  I was just kidding around.  Jerk bending, still got it. ",313,14.0
7982,Zuko, Listen everybody;  I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff. ,313,12.0
7983,Toph,  Don't look at me. I didn't touch your stuff. ,313,9.0
7984,Zuko, I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone.,313,7.0
7985,Katara, I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know... how it would have been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago? ,313,27.0
7986,Zuko, Well it's not lost. It's just weaker for some reason.,313,10.0
7987,Katara,  Maybe you're just not as  as you think you are. ,313,10.0
7988,Toph, Ouch. ,313,1.0
7989,Zuko, I bet it's because I changed sides. ,313,7.0
7990,Katara, That's ridiculous. ,313,2.0
7991,Aang," I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes fromrage, and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to. ",313,26.0
7992,Sokka,"  So, all we need to do is make Zuko angry... easy enough.",313,12.0
7993,Zuko,"  Ok, cut it out!  Look... even if you're right,  I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.",313,25.0
7994,Toph, You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending  from a different source. I recommendthe original source. ,313,17.0
7995,Sokka, How's he supposed to do that? By jumping into a volcano? ,313,11.0
7996,Toph,  No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is.,313,14.0
7997,Sokka, So is it jumping into a volcano?,313,7.0
7998,Toph,"  One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave.   I don't know. For earthbending,  the original benders were badgermoles. ",313,24.0
7999,Aang,"  That's amazing, Toph. I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the Sky Bison. Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime buddy. ",313,25.0
8000,Zuko," Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct. ",313,14.0
8001,Aang," What do you mean? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty ofdragons when I was a kid.",313,18.0
8002,Zuko,"  Well, they aren't around anymore, ok?",313,6.0
8003,Aang," Ok, ok.  I'm sorry. ",313,4.0
8004,Zuko, But maybe there's another way.  The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors. ,313,18.0
8005,Aang,"  Sun Warriors? Well, I know  weren't around when I was a kid. ",313,12.0
8006,Zuko," No, they died off thousands of years ago, but their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.",313,29.0
8007,Aang," It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.",313,20.0
8008,Sokka,"  So, what?  Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing  where they stood 1000 years ago?",313,21.0
8009,Zuko," We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.   More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher. ",313,39.0
8010,Aang," Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude. ",313,17.0
8011,Zuko,  I can't believe this. ,313,4.0
8012,Aang, Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.,313,8.0
8013,Zuko and Aang, Whoa!,313,1.0
8014,Zuko," Even though these buildings are ancient,  there's something eerily familiar about them. I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these. ",313,24.0
8015,Aang,"  Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.  Ok, we learned something about architecture.  Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher. ",313,30.0
8016,Zuko,"  I can't believe it. This booby trap must be centuries old, and it still works. ",313,15.0
8017,Aang, There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.,313,12.0
8018,Zuko,"  Where's that upbeat attitude you were talking about? Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting. ",313,19.0
8019,Aang, Look. This seems promising.  Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending. ,313,18.0
8020,Zuko, They look pretty angry to me. ,313,6.0
8021,Aang, I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors. ,313,10.0
8022,Zuko," Well, they had a funny way of showing it.",313,9.0
8023,Aang," Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last 100 years. Something you're not telling me. ",313,16.0
8024,Zuko," He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. They were the ultimate firebenders. And if you could conquer one, your firebending talentswould become legendary, and you'd earn the honorary title ""Dragon"".  The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born,  by my Uncle.  My great-grandfather Sozin happened.",313,50.0
8025,Aang," But I thought your Uncle was, I don't know, good? ",313,10.0
8026,Zuko," He had a complicated past. Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.",313,13.0
8027,Aang, It's locked up.,313,3.0
8028,Zuko," Wait.  It's a celestial calendar. Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. I bet that Sun Stone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits it at just the right angle, on the solstice. ",313,36.0
8029,Aang,  Monkey feathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.,313,11.0
8030,Zuko, No we can't.  But we might be able to speed time up. Let's see if we can outsmart the Sun Stone. ,313,21.0
8031,Aang, Nothing's happening.,313,2.0
8032,Zuko,  Come on...,313,2.0
8033,Aang,"  You know, Zuko, I don't care  what everyone else says about you,  you're pretty smart.",313,15.0
8034,Zuko, Relax. They're just statues.,313,4.0
8035,Aang,"  Zuko, get over here. Iwant you to dance with me.    It says this is something called The Dancing Dragon. ",313,19.0
8036,Zuko,  What?,313,1.0
8037,Aang, Let's follow the steps of the statues.  Just do it. ,313,10.0
8038,Zuko,  This better teach us some really good firebending.,313,8.0
8039,Aang,  Hurray! Wait. What exactly  that? ,313,5.0
8040,Zuko, It's some kind of mystical gem stone. ,313,7.0
8041,Aang," Well, don't touch it! ",313,4.0
8042,Zuko, Why not?,313,2.0
8043,Aang," Remember what happened out there with those spikes  I'm just very suspicious of giant, glowing gems sitting on pedestals.",313,19.0
8044,Zuko, It feels almost alive.,313,4.0
8045,Aang,"  Oh, no, it's another trap! ",313,5.0
8046,Zuko," Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue. ",313,11.0
8047,Aang,"  I can't move. Zuko, do something!",313,6.0
8048,Zuko, Me? I can't move either.,313,5.0
8049,Aang, It stopped. ,313,2.0
8050,Zuko, At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm we can figure a way out of this.,313,18.0
8051,Aang," You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?",313,10.0
8052,Zuko," At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd neverhave made it pass the courtyard.",313,19.0
8053,Aang,  Help!,313,1.0
8054,Zuko,  are you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries. ,313,9.0
8055,Aang," Well, what do you think we should do?",313,8.0
8056,Zuko, Think about our place in the Universe? ,313,7.0
8057,Sun Warrior Chief," For trying to take our Sun Stone, you must be severely punished!  Who is down there? ",313,16.0
8058,Zuko,  We didn't come here to take your Sun Stone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.,313,20.0
8059,Ham Gao," Yeah, right. They are obviously thieves, here to steal Sun Warrior treasures. ",313,12.0
8060,Aang," Just hear us out.   Please, I don't normally play this card, but...  I'm the Avatar.",313,15.0
8061,Zuko," My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. Or at least, Iused to be. I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending,  to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way,  the original way. When we came here, I never imagined  the Sun Warrior civilization was secretly alive. I am truly humbled to be in your presence.  Please, teach us. ",313,71.0
8062,Sun Warrior Chief,"  If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you must learn them from the masters Ran and Shao.",313,20.0
8063,Aang, Ran and Shao? There are two of them?,313,8.0
8064,Sun Warrior Chief,"  If you're going to see the masters,  you must bring them a piece of the eternal flame.  This fire is the very first one. It was given to Man by the dragons. We have kept it going for thousands of years.    When you present yourselves to them, they will examine you. They'll read your hearts, your souls, and your ancestry.  If they deem you worthy,  they'll teach you. If they don't,  you'll be destroyed on the spot. ",313,77.0
8065,Zuko,  I don't believe it.,313,4.0
8066,Sun Warrior Chief," You will each take a piece of it to the masters,  to show your commitment to the sacred art of firebending.",313,21.0
8067,Aang,"  Um, Mister Sun Chief, sir? Yeah... I'm not a firebender yet. Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me? ",313,20.0
8068,Sun Warrior Chief," This ritual illustrates the essence of Sun Warriorphilosophy.You must maintain a constant heat.  The flame will go out if you make it too small.  Make it too big, and you might lose control.    No. ",313,34.0
8069,Aang, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.  It's like a little heartbeat.,313,12.0
8070,Sun Warrior Chief," Fire is life, not just destruction. . You will take your flames up there.  The cave of the masters is beneath that rock. ",313,23.0
8071,Zuko, Hurry up.,313,2.0
8072,Aang," I can't. If I walk too fast, myflame will go out. ",313,11.0
8073,Zuko, Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small. You're too timid. Give it more juice.,313,16.0
8074,Aang,  But what if I can't control it?,313,7.0
8075,Zuko, You can do it. I know you can. You're a talented kid.,313,12.0
8076,Sun Warrior Chief,  Facing the judgment of thefirebending masters will be very dangerous for you. Your ancestors  are directly responsible for the dragons' disappearances. The masters might not be so happy to see you.,313,31.0
8077,Ham Gao,  I know I wouldn't be.,313,5.0
8078,Aang,  But once they find out I'm the Avatar...,313,8.0
8079,Sun Warrior Chief, Have you forgotten that you vanished allowing the FireNation to wreak havoc on the world? The decline of the dragons is your burden too. ,313,24.0
8080,Aang, We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we hoped. ,313,14.0
8081,Zuko," No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them. ",313,21.0
8082,Aang, What if they judge us and attack us? ,313,8.0
8083,Zuko,"  Bring 'em out.  Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar.  I think we can take these guys in a fight, whoever they are. ",313,24.0
8084,Sun Warrior Chief,  Sound the call.   Chanters! ,313,4.0
8085,Aang,"  Zuko, my fire went out.  What's happening?",313,7.0
8086,Zuko,  What do you want  to do? ,313,6.0
8087,Aang, Give me some of yours. ,313,5.0
8088,Zuko," No, just make your own.",313,5.0
8089,Aang, I can't. ,313,2.0
8090,Zuko, Get some from one of those warriors.  Hurry. Stop cheating off me! ,313,12.0
8091,Aang,  Quit being stingy!,313,3.0
8092,Aang and Zuko, Uh-oh.,313,1.0
8093,Zuko, These are the masters. ,313,4.0
8094,Aang,  You still think we can take 'em?,313,7.0
8095,Zuko, Shh. I never said that.,313,5.0
8096,Ham Gao," Oh, here it comes.  Any moment now... dinner for the masters.",313,11.0
8097,Sun Warrior Chief,"  Quiet, Ham Gao. ",313,3.0
8098,Ham Gao, What?  Everyone's thinking it.,313,4.0
8099,Aang,"  Zuko, I think we're supposed to do The Dragon Dance with them.",313,12.0
8100,Zuko, What? What about this situation that you think they want us to dance? ,313,13.0
8101,Aang," Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it.",313,13.0
8102,Zuko, Fine.,313,1.0
8103,Sun Warrior Chief, Judgment time.,313,2.0
8104,Zuko," Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.   I understand.",313,15.0
8105,Aang, Like firebending harmony.,313,3.0
8106,Sun Warrior Chief," Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending.",313,13.0
8107,Zuko, I can't believe there are still living dragons. My Uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it. ,313,20.0
8108,Aang," So, your Uncle lied.",313,4.0
8109,Sun Warrior Chief," Actually,  it wasn't a total lie. Iroh was the last outsider to face the masters. They deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well. ",313,27.0
8110,Zuko," He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them.",313,14.0
8111,Aang," All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurtKatara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is... it's energy, and life.",313,29.0
8112,Zuko," Yeah. It's like the Sun,  but inside of you. Do you guys realize this? ",313,14.0
8113,Sun Warrior Chief," Well, our civilization  called the Sun Warriors... so yeah.",313,9.0
8114,Zuko," That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so manyyears, hunting you  was my drive... it was my purpose. So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive. I have to help you  defeat my father and restore balance to the world.",313,54.0
8115,Sun Warrior Chief," Now that you have learned the secrets, and you know about our tribe's existence,  we have no choice but to imprison you here forever.  Just kidding.  But seriously,   tell anyone!",313,30.0
8116,Aang," With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I would be unstoppable. ",313,13.0
8117,Sokka," Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.",313,9.0
8118,Zuko,  It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.,313,8.0
8119,Sokka, We'll just tap-dance  our way to victory over the Fire Lord.,313,11.0
8120,Zuko,  It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!,313,12.0
8121,Katara, Oh yeah? What's your  form called?,313,6.0
8122,Zuko,  The Dancing Dragon. ,313,3.0
8123,Zuko,  No one can make tea like Uncle.  But hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke? ,314,24.0
8124,Katara, Sure. ,314,1.0
8125,Aang, I like jokes. ,314,3.0
8126,Toph, Bring it. ,314,2.0
8127,Zuko," Okay.  Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line  is, ""Leaf me alone, I'm bushed.""  Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it. ",314,25.0
8128,Katara, Right. Maybe that's because he remembers  the whole thing. ,314,9.0
8129,Toph, It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.  It hardly ever happens. ,314,14.0
8130,Sokka,"  Hey, can I talk to you for a second? ",314,9.0
8131,Zuko, So  what's up?,314,3.0
8132,Sokka,"  If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken? ",314,13.0

8134,Sokka," When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where  they might be. ",314,20.0
8135,Zuko, I can't tell you. ,314,4.0

8139,Zuko, It's not good Sokka. ,314,4.0
8140,Sokka, Please. ,314,1.0
8141,Zuko,  My guess is...  They were taken to the Boiling Rock. ,314,10.0
8142,Sokka,  What's that? ,314,2.0
8143,Zuko,  The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.  It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.  It's inescapable. ,314,21.0
8144,Sokka, So where is this place? ,314,5.0

8146,Sokka," Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid. ",314,5.0
8147,Zuko,  It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here. ,314,24.0
8148,Sokka, Thanks Zuko.  Just knowing makes me feel better. ,314,8.0
8149,Zuko," Not up to anything, huh?  Yeah, I'm sure it does. (",314,11.0
8150,Sokka," Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my Dad.  You happy now? ",314,12.0
8151,Zuko, I'm never happy. ,314,3.0
8152,Sokka," Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was  idea. It was  decision to stay when things were going wrong.  It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it.  I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me Zuko. ",314,42.0
8153,Zuko," You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you. ",314,15.0

8157,Katara," Need meat. Gone fishing.  Back in a few days.  Sokka and Zuko. One more thing.  Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badger frog croak.  Zuko. )",314,42.0

8160,Zuko,"  What?    Yeah, fluffy. ",314,3.0
8161,Sokka," What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons. ",314,17.0

8882,Aang, About Sozin's Comet...  I was actually going to wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.,318,18.0
8883,Zuko, After? ,318,1.0
8884,Aang, I'm not ready.  I need more time to master firebending.,318,10.0

8901,Fire Lord Ozai," When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom.  Permanently.

9079,Bumi, That's the one. ,319,3.0
9080,Jeong Jeong," The White Lotus has always been about philosophy, and beauty and truth.  About a month ago, a call went out that we were needed for something important. ",319,27.0
9081,Pakku,"  It came from a Grand Lotus, your Uncle,  Iroh of the Fire Nation. ",319,13.0
9082,Toph, Well that's who we're looking for. ,319,6.0
9083,Piandao,  Then we'll take you to him.,319,6.0

9085,Sokka, He's gone. And so is Aang. ,319,6.0
9086,Bumi," Oh well, so long as they have each other I'm sure  we have nothing  to worry about. Let's go.",319,19.0
9087,Aang," Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom. ",319,6.0
9088,Avatar Kyoshi," In my day,  Chin the Conqueror threatened to throw the World out of balance.  I stopped him and the World entered a great era of peace. ",319,26.0
9089,Aang,"  But you didn't really kill Chin,  technically he fell to his own doom because  he was too stubborn to get out of the way.",319,24.0
9090,Avatar Kyoshi,"  Personally I don't really see the difference but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to  Chin.  I offer you this wisdom, Aang.  Only justice will bring peace. ",319,31.0
9091,Aang, I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi. ,319,7.0
9092,Sokka," So Bumi,  how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu? ",319,12.0
9093,Bumi," Escape? I didn't escape, everybody else escaped.  There I was,  back in Omashu, waiting for  the right  moment. I didn't know  what or when but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.  An eclipse. That would do it.",319,40.0
9094,Fire Nation soldier,What do you  think you're doing? ,319,6.0
9095,Bumi, Taking back my city. You've got no  fire power and it's payback time.,319,13.0
9096,Suki," Wow, you took back your whole city all by yourself. ",319,10.0

9099,Sokka," No, not really. (",319,4.0
9100,Aang, I need to look deep inside myself. ,319,7.0
9101,Avatar Kuruk,"  I am Avatar Kuruk. When I was young,  I was always  a ""go with the flow"" kind of Avatar. People seemed to work out their own problems  and there was peace and  good times in the World.  But then,  I lost the woman I loved to Koh,  the face stealer.  It was my fault, if I had been more attentive and more active, I could have saved her. Aang, you must actively shape your own destiny, and  the destiny of the World.",319,82.0
9102,Bumi," Well, here we are.  Welcome to old people camp. ",319,9.0
9103,Zuko, Where... where is he?,319,4.0

9105,Katara, Are you okay? ,319,3.0
9106,Zuko," No,  I'm not okay. My Uncle hates me, I know it.  He loved me and supported me in every way he could and I still turned against him. How can I even face him? ",319,34.0
9107,Katara,"  Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right? ",319,8.0
9108,Zuko, More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life. ,319,11.0
9109,Katara,  Then he'll forgive you.  He will. ,319,6.0
9110,Zuko, Uncle. ,319,1.0
9111,Aang,"  All these past Avatars,  they keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it.  You're right, maybe an air nomad Avatar would understand where I'm coming from.  I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think.  I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that. ",319,54.0
9112,Avatar Yangchen," I am Avatar Yangchen,  young airbender. ",319,6.0
9113,Aang,"  Avatar Yangchen, the monks always  taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web. ",319,24.0
9114,Avatar Yangchen,"  Yes, all life is sacred. ",319,5.0
9115,Aang," I know, I'm  even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever and I've only had to use violence for necessary defence and I've certainly  never used it to take a life.",319,38.0
9116,Avatar Yangchen,"  Avatar Aang,  I know that you're a gentle spirit and the monks have taught you well. But this isn't about you, ( this is about the World. ",319,27.0
9117,Aang, But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the World so my spirit could be free. ,319,20.0
9118,Avatar Yangchen,"  Many great and wise air nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment but the Avatar  can never do it because your sole duty is  the World. Here is my wisdom for you,  selfless duty  calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs and do whatever  it takes to protect the World.",319,52.0
9119,Aang,"  I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.  I have to kill the Fire Lord.",319,15.0
9120,Zuko,"  How can you forgive me so easily? I thought you would be furious with me.   Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me.  But I want  you to know, I'm so  so sorry, Uncle.  I'm so sorry and ashamed of what I did.  I don't know  how I can ever make it up to you but  I'll...",319,60.0
9121,Iroh, I was never angry with you. I was sad  because I was afraid you lost your way. ,319,17.0
9122,Zuko,  I did lose my way. ,319,5.0
9123,Iroh, But you found it again.  And you did it by yourself. And  I am so happy you found your way here. ,319,21.0
9124,Zuko," It wasn't that hard, Uncle.  You have a pretty strong scent. (",319,12.0
9125,Aang," They're not getting larger, they're getting closer.  The whole island is moving! (  Wait,  is it just me or are those mountains getting bigger? ",319,24.0
9126,Zuko,"  Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar  who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.",319,16.0
9127,Toph,  You mean the Fire Lord. ,319,5.0
9128,Zuko, That's what I just said. ,319,5.0
9129,Iroh, Hmm...,319,1.0
9130,Zuko, We need you to come with us. ,319,7.0
9131,Iroh,"  No, Zuko. It won't turn out well. ",319,7.0
9132,Zuko, You can beat him and we'll  be there to help. ,319,10.0
9133,Iroh,"  Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that  I could. It will be the wrong way to end the war.  History would see it as just more senseless violence,  a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord. ",319,58.0
9134,Zuko,  And then... then would you come and take your rightful place on the throne? ,319,14.0
9135,Iroh,"  No. Someone ( new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart and  unquestionable honour. It has to be you,  Prince Zuko. ",319,24.0
9136,Zuko,  Unquestionable honour? But I've made  so many mistakes. ,319,8.0
9137,Iroh,"  Yes, you have.  You struggled, you suffered but you have always followed  own path, you  restored your  honour. And only you  can restore the honour of the Fire Nation. ",319,29.0
9138,Zuko," I'll try, Uncle. ",319,3.0
9139,Toph,"  Well,  what if Aang doesn't come back? ",319,7.0
9140,Iroh," Sozin's Comet is arriving and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord.  When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.  Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it  from the Fire Nation so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.",319,58.0
9141,Suki,  That's why you gathered  the members of the White Lotus. ,319,10.0
9142,Iroh," Yes.  Zuko,  you must return to the Fire Nation so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order.  But Azula will be there, waiting  for you.",319,34.0
9143,Zuko,  I can handle Azula. ,319,4.0
9144,Iroh,  Not alone.  You'll need help.,319,5.0
9145,Zuko," You're right.  Katara,  how would you like to help me put Azula in her place? ",319,15.0
9146,Katara,  It would be my pleasure.,319,5.0
9147,Sokka,  What  about us?  What's  our destiny today?,319,7.0
9148,Iroh,  What do you think it is?,319,6.0
9149,Sokka,"  I think that... even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do  everything we can to stop the airship fleet. ",319,23.0
9150,Toph," And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us. ",319,18.0
9151,Piandao, Nothing runs faster over land or swims quicker than a giant eel-hound.  The airship base is on a small island just off the EarthKingdom shore. ( You should be able  to intercept the fleet within a day's journey. ,319,38.0
9152,Sokka," Thank you, Master. ",319,3.0
9153,Zuko," So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?",319,19.0
9154,Iroh,"  After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se,  I'm going to re-conquer  my tea shop and I'm going  to play Pai Sho  everyday. ",319,21.0

9156,Iroh," Goodbye, everyone.  Today,  destiny is our friend.  I know it.",319,10.0
9157,Aang," A lion turtle.  Maybe you can  help me. Everyone,  even my own past lives are expecting me to end someone's life. But I don't know if I can do it. ",319,30.0
9158,Lion Turtle," Wait for him, he will come.   The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart  can touch the poison of hatred without being harmed.  Since beginningless time,  darkness thrives in the void,  but always yields to purifying light. ",319,45.0
9159,Ozai, It's time for this World to end in fire and for a new World  to be born from the ashes.,319,20.0
9160,Katara," Zuko, don't worry, we can take Azula.",320,7.0
9161,Zuko," I'm not worried about her, I'm worried about Aang. What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my Father? What if he loses?",320,25.0
9162,Katara, Aang won't lose. He's gonna come back. He has to. ,320,10.0
9163,Azula,  What am I holding?,320,4.0
9164,Servant Girl,"  A cherry pit, Princess. ",320,4.0
9165,Azula, Correct. And what day is this?,320,6.0
9166,Servant Girl, It is the day of your coronation.,320,7.0
9167,Azula," Yes, it is. So please, tell me why on the most important day of my life you decided to leave a pit in my cherry? ",320,25.0
9168,Servant Girl, It wasn't a decision. It was just a small mistake.,320,10.0
9169,Azula, Small? Do you realize what could have happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time?  ,320,16.0
9170,Servant Girl, I supposed you could have... choked? ,320,6.0
9171,Azula, Yes. Then you will understand the severity of your crime. ,320,10.0

9173,Azula,"  Oh very well. Since this is a special day, I will show mercy.  You are banished. Leave this palace immediately. What are you all looking at? I have two feet that need scrubbing.

9182,Dai Li Agent, A... few minutes I guess? ,320,5.0
