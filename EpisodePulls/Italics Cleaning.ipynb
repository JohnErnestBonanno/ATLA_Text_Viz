I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And  take this to my quarters.<b>Iroh</b>: Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?<b>Aang</b>: So... I guess you never fought an airbender before. I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.<b>Guard 1</b>: Silence!<b>Guard 2</b>: The Avatar has escaped!<b>Sokka</b> : Go. Fly. Soar.<b>Katara</b>: Please, Appa, we need your help.

Yip yip!<b>Iroh</b> : Huh?<b>Zuko</b>: Shoot them down!<b>Iroh</b>: Good news for the Fire Lord. The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.<b>Zuko</b>: That kid, Uncle, just did this.  I won't underestimate him again. Dig this ship out and follow them!  As soon as you're done with that.<b>Katara</b>: How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.<b>Aang</b> : I don't know. I just sort of... did it.<b>Katara</b>: Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?<b>Aang</b>: Because... I never wanted to be.<b>Katara</b>: But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.<b>Aang</b> : And how am I going to do that?<b>Katara</b>: According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?<b>Aang</b>: That's what the monks told me.<b>Katara</b>: Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.<b>Aang</b> : We can learn it together!<b>Katara</b>: And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.<b>Sokka</b> : I'd like that. I'd really like that.<b>Katara</b>: Then we're in this together.<b>Aang</b> : All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to  here, here, and here.<b>Katara</b>: What's there?<b>Aang</b>: Here  we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaaay over here  we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!\n"
