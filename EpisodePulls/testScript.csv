1,Sokka,"I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?",19
2,Katara,Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident.,8
3,Aang,"Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well...  ...we “boobied” right into it.",19

13,Katara,"Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.",7

53,Zuko,I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. Meditating. You're just a child!,13
54,Aang,"Well, you're just a teenager.",5
55,Aang,"If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?",12
56,Katara,"No, Aang! Don't do this!",5
57,Aang,"Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay. Take care of Appa for me until I get back.",16
58,Zuko,Head a course to the Fire Nation. I'm going home.<u>,10
59,Katara,"We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe; now we have to save him.",18
60,Sokka,"Katara, I—",2

72,Katara,Appa!,1
73,Sokka,"You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?",12
74,Zuko,"This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And  take this to my quarters.",34
75,Iroh,"Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?",10
76,Aang,So... I guess you never fought an airbender before. I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.,23
77,Guard 1,Silence!,1
78,Guard 2,The Avatar has escaped!,4

100,Aang,I dropped my staff.,4
101,Sokka,Got it!,2
102,Sokka,Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!,6
103,Sokka,Katara!,1
104,Katara,"Hurry up, Sokka!",3
105,Sokka,I'm just a guy with a boomerang; I didn't ask for all this flying and magic.,16
106,Sokka,Yip yip! Yip yip!,4
107,Iroh,Huh?,1

109,Iroh,Good news for the Fire Lord. The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.,15
110,Zuko,"That kid, Uncle, just did this.  I won't underestimate him again. Dig this ship out and follow them! As soon as you're done with that.",25
111,Katara,How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,17
112,Aang,I don't know. I just sort of... did it.,9
113,Katara,Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?,9
114,Aang,Because... I never wanted to be.,6
115,Katara,"But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.",19
116,Aang,And how am I going to do that?,8
117,Katara,"According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?",14
118,Aang,That's what the monks told me.,6
119,Katara,"Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.",12
120,Aang,We can learn it together!,5
121,Katara,"And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.",14
122,Sokka,I'd like that. I'd really like that.,7
123,Katara,Then we're in this together.,5
124,Aang,"All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to  here, here, and here.",19
125,Katara,What's there?,2
126,Aang,"Here  we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaaay over here  we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!",39
